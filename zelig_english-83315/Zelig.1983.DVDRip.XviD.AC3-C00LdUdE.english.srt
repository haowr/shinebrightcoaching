1
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,994
He was the phenomenon
of the twenties.

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,302
When you think that he was
as well-known as Lindbergh...

3
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,535
it's really quite astonishing.

4
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,874
His story reflected the nature
of our civilization...

5
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,883
the character of our times.

6
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,943
Yet it was also
one man's story...

7
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,445
and all the themes
of our culture were there...

8
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,323
heroism, will,
things like that...

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,228
but when you look back on it,
it was very strange.

10
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,958
Well, it is ironic...

11
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,129
to see how quickly
he has faded from memory...

12
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,470
considering what
an astounding record he made.

13
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,975
He was,
of course, very amusing...

14
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,969
but at the same time
touched a nerve in people...

15
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:26,475
perhaps in a way in which they
would prefer not to be touched.

16
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,920
It certainly is
a very bizarre story.

17
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,797
The year is 1928.

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,799
America, enjoying a decade
of unequaled prosperity...

19
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,402
has gone wild.

20
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,572
The Jazz Age, it is called.

21
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,277
The rhythms are syncopated.
The morals are looser.

22
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,946
The liquor is cheaper,
when you can get it.

23
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:06,425
It is a time of diverse heroes
and madcap stunts...

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,259
of speak-easies
and flamboyant parties.

25
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,094
One typical party occurs
at the Long Island estate...

26
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,466
of Mr. And Mrs.
Henry Porter Sutton...

27
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,563
socialites,
patrons of the arts.

28
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,073
Politicians and poets...

29
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,076
rub elbows
with the cream of high society.

30
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,079
Present at the party
is Scott Fitzgerald...

31
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,445
who is to cast perspective
on the twenties...

32
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,780
for all future generations.

33
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,149
He writes in his notebook...

34
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,155
about a curious little man
named Leon Selwyn, or Zelman...

35
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,158
who seemed clearly
to be an aristocrat...

36
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:43,720
and extolled the very rich
as he chatted with socialites.

37
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,732
He spoke adoringly of Coolidge
and the Republican Party...

38
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,564
all in an upper-class
Boston accent.

39
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,467
"An hour later,"
writes Fitzgerald...

40
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,473
"I was stunned
to see the same man...

41
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,475
"speaking with
the kitchen help.

42
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,307
"Now he claimed
to be a Democrat...

43
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:04,248
"and his accent seemed coarse,
as if he were one of the crowd."

44
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,811
It's the first small notice
taken of Leonard Zelig.

45
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,550
Florida, one year later.

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,490
An odd incident occurs...

47
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,494
at the New York Yankees'
training camp.

48
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,428
Journalists,
anxious as always...

49
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:21,627
to immortalize the exploits
of the great home-run hitters...

50
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,636
notice a strange new player...

51
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,639
waiting his turn at bat
after Babe Ruth.

52
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,766
He's listed on the roster
as Lou Zelig...

53
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,300
but no one on the team
has heard of him.

54
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,437
Security guards are called...

55
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,276
and he's escorted
from the premises.

56
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:40,378
It appears as a small item
in the next day's newspaper.

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,828
Chicago, Illinois,
that same year.

58
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,955
There is a private party...

59
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,831
at a speak-easy
on the South Side.

60
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,062
People from the most
respectable walks of life...

61
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,266
dance and drink bathtub gin.

62
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,371
Present that evening
was Calvin Turner, a waiter.

63
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,384
A lot of gangsters
come in the place.

64
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,387
They're good tippers
and take care of us.

65
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,787
We take care of our customers.

66
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:21,282
On this particular night,
here's a strange guy coming in.

67
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,090
I'd never seen him before.

68
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,255
So I asked the one
or the other...

69
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,094
I said, "John,
you know this guy?

70
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,690
"You ever seen him?"
So he looks.

71
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,463
"No. I ain't never
seen him before.

72
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,696
"I don't know who he is...

73
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,432
"but I know one thing...
he's a tough-Iooking hombre."

74
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,201
So I looked over, and then...

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,707
the next thing,
the guy had disappeared.

76
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,040
I don't know where he went to.

77
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,545
But about this time,
the music starts...

78
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,707
and the band
started playing.

79
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,708
I looked. Here's a colored boy
over there playing trumpet.

80
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,382
Man, he was playing back,
and I looked at the guy...

81
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,789
and I said, "He looks
just like that gangster...

82
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:57,728
"but the gangster was white,
and this guy is black."

83
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,790
So I don't know
what's happening.

84
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:05,065
New York City.
It is several months later.

85
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:09,040
Police are investigating
the disappearance of a clerk...

86
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,542
named Leonard Zelig.

87
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,874
Both his landlady
and his employer...

88
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,709
have reported him missing.

89
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:19,275
They tell police he was an odd
little man who kept to himself.

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,379
Two clues are found in
Zelig's Greenwich Village flat.

91
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:27,985
One, a photograph of Zelig
with Eugene O'Neill...

92
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,292
and one of him as Pagliacci.

93
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:39,236
Acting on a tip, they trace
his whereabouts to Chinatown...

94
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,241
where, in the rear
of a Chinese establishment...

95
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,300
a strange-Iooking Oriental...

96
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,802
who fits the description
of Leonard Zelig is discovered.

97
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,305
Suspicious, the detectives
try to pull off his disguise...

98
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,788
but it is not a disguise,
and a fight breaks out.

99
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,622
He is removed by force
and taken to Manhattan Hospital.

100
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,719
In the ambulance,
he rants and curses...

101
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,230
in what sounds
like authentic Chinese.

102
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,631
He is restrained
with a straitjacket.

103
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,126
When he emerges from the car
twenty minutes later...

104
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,801
incredibly, he is no longer
Chinese, but Caucasian.

105
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,812
Bewildered interns place him
in the emergency room...

106
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,814
for observation.

107
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,545
At 7 a.m., Dr. Eudora Fletcher,
a psychiatrist...

108
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,816
makes her usual rounds.

109
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,824
When I first heard
about this emergency case...

110
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,826
I didn't think
anything peculiar...

111
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,829
and when I first
laid eyes on him...

112
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:42,893
it was a bit strange because
I mistook him for a doctor.

113
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,530
He had a very professional
demeanor about him.

114
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,437
As a young psychiatrist...

115
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,443
Eudora Fletcher is fascinated
by Leonard Zelig.

116
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,776
She convinces the conservative
staff at the hospital...

117
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,647
to allow her to pursue
a study of the new admission.

118
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,083
So, what do you do?

119
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,110
Oh, me? I'm a psychiatrist.

120
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:07,187
I work mostly
with delusional paranoids.

121
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,285
Tell me about it.

122
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,795
There's not much to tell.

123
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,298
I work mostly
on the continent...

124
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:16,301
and I've written quite a few
psychoanalytic papers.

125
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,133
I worked with Freud in Vienna.

126
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,970
We broke over the concept
of penis envy.

127
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:26,035
Freud felt that it
should be limited to women.

128
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,037
It's not that he was
making any sense at all.

129
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,051
It was a conglomeration
of psychological double-talk...

130
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,053
that he had apparently heard...

131
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,351
or was familiar with
through reading.

132
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,290
The funny thing was
his delivery was quite fluid...

133
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,793
and might have been
convincing...

134
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,025
to someone
who did not know any better.

135
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,033
Who was this Leonard Zelig
that seemed to create...

136
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,035
such diverse impressions
everywhere?

137
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,062
All that was known of him
was that he was the son...

138
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,075
of a Yiddish actor
named Morris Zelig...

139
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,974
whose performance as Puck...

140
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,412
in the Orthodox version of
"A Midsummer Night's Dream"...

141
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,916
was coolly received.

142
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,010
The elder Zelig's
second marriage...

143
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,750
is marked by constant violent
quarreling, so much so...

144
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,759
that although the family
lives over a bowling alley...

145
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,990
it's the bowling alley
that complains of noise.

146
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,591
As a boy, Leonard is frequently
bullied by anti-Semites.

147
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,603
His parents,
who never take his part...

148
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,630
and blame him for everything,
side with the anti-Semites.

149
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,610
They punish him often
by locking him in a dark closet.

150
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,613
When they are really angry...

151
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,343
they get into the closet
with him.

152
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,352
On his deathbed,
Morris Zelig tells his son...

153
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,355
that life is a meaningless
nightmare of suffering...

154
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:48,486
and the only advice he gives him
is to save string.

155
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,292
Though brother Jack
has a nervous breakdown...

156
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,663
and sister Ruth becomes
a shoplifter and alcoholic...

157
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,136
Leonard Zelig appears
to have adjusted to life.

158
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,071
Somehow, he seems to have coped.

159
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:06,602
And then, suddenly,
increasingly strange behavior.

160
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,145
Fascinated
by the Zelig phenomenon...

161
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:14,152
Dr. Fletcher arranges
a series of experiments...

162
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,713
and invites the skeptical staff
to observe.

163
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:23,593
With the doctors watching, Zelig
becomes a perfect psychiatrist.

164
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,087
When two Frenchmen
are brought in...

165
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:31,035
Zelig assumes their characters
and speaks reasonable French.

166
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,039
In the company
of a Chinese person...

167
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,304
he begins to develop
Oriental features.

168
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,801
By now, word has gotten out
to the press...

169
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,815
and the public, thirsting
for thrills and novelty...

170
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,147
is immediately captivated.

171
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,487
The clamor is so great...

172
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,426
that Dr. Allan Sindell
is forced to issue a statement.

173
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,952
We're beginning
to realize the dimensions...

174
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,125
of what could be the scientific
medical phenomenon of the age...

175
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,567
and possibly of all time.

176
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,935
Fresh stories roll off
the press every day...

177
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,998
about Zelig
and his puzzling condition.

178
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:13,000
Although the doctors claim
to have the situation in hand...

179
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,446
no two can agree
on a diagnosis.

180
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,973
I'm convinced
it's glandular in nature...

181
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,486
and although there's
no evidence of misfunction...

182
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,921
further tests will show
a problem in the secretions.

183
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,222
It's something he picked up
from eating Mexican food.

184
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,728
This manifestation
is neurological in origin.

185
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,221
This patient is suffering
from a brain tumor...

186
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:39,169
and I should not be surprised
if within several weeks he died.

187
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,164
We have not been able
to locate the tumor...

188
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,074
but we're still looking.

189
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,672
Ironically,
within two weeks' time...

190
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,673
it is Dr. Birsky himself
who dies of a brain tumor.

191
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,482
Leonard Zelig is fine.

192
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,681
Throughout the weeks
of testing and speculation...

193
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,624
Eudora Fletcher
begins to feel...

194
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,128
that the patient
might be suffering...

195
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,130
not from
a physiological disorder...

196
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,632
but from a psychological one.

197
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,125
It is Zelig's unstable makeup,
she suggests...

198
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,138
that accounts
for his metamorphoses.

199
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:18,132
The governing board of doctors
is hostile to her notion.

200
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,145
They conclude
that Zelig's malady...

201
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,637
can be traced to poor alignment
of the vertebrae.

202
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,345
Tests prove them wrong...

203
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,377
and cause a temporary problem
for the patient.

204
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,517
Now the press and public
hang on every bit of news...

205
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,587
thoroughly absorbed
in the real-life drama.

206
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,431
The continuing saga
at Manhattan Hospital goes on.

207
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,631
This morning, doctors report,
experiments were conducted.

208
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,004
Several women were placed
in proximity to the subject...

209
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,941
but no change occurred...

210
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,773
leading authorities
to conclude...

211
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,643
that the phenomenon
does not occur with women.

212
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,014
Doctors will experiment
with a midget and a chicken.

213
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,958
Leonard Zelig continues
to astound scientists...

214
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,053
at New York's
Manhattan Hospital...

215
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,463
where numerous tests
have led nowhere...

216
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,229
in determining the nature of
this astonishing manifestation.

217
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,237
He is confronted
by two overweight men...

218
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,739
at the request of the doctors.

219
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,242
As the men
discuss their obesity...

220
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,744
an initially reticent Zelig
joins in...

221
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,146
swelling himself
to a miraculous 250 pounds.

222
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,379
Next, in the presence
of two Negro men...

223
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,650
Zelig rapidly
becomes one himself.

224
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,385
What will they think of next?

225
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:44,328
Meanwhile, Americans all over
have their own reactions.

226
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:48,026
I wish I could be Lenny Zelig,
the changing man.

227
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,864
I'd be different people.

228
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,166
Someday my wishes
will come true.

229
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,664
Leonard Zelig is
one of the finest gentlemen...

230
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,177
in the United States of America.

231
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,738
He is the cat's pajamas.

232
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,682
Trying a new approach...

233
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,777
Dr. Fletcher places the subject
under hypnosis.

234
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,018
Tell me why you assume
the characteristics...

235
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,025
of the person you're with.

236
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:19,622
- It's safe.
- What do you mean safe?

237
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,634
Safe...

238
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,126
to be like the others.

239
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:30,131
You want to be safe?

240
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,145
I want to be liked.

241
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,247
Probing Zelig's unconscious...

242
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,251
Dr. Fletcher gradually
puts together the pieces...

243
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,413
of Zelig's behavioral puzzle.

244
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,922
Dividing her time
between the hospital...

245
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:49,053
and the 42nd-Street Library,
she writes her report.

246
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,562
A closed meeting
of doctors listens...

247
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:56,159
as Dr. Fletcher describes Zelig
as a human chameleon.

248
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,171
Like the lizard
that is endowed by nature...

249
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,105
with a marvelous
protective device...

250
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,574
that enables it
to change color...

251
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,578
and blend in with
its immediate surrounding...

252
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,671
Zelig, too, protects himself...

253
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,842
by becoming
whoever he is around.

254
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,853
The doctors listen,
and their reaction is skeptical.

255
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,117
"Impossible," they claim.
"Preposterous."

256
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,125
"If he's a lizard,"
quips one doctor...

257
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,128
"then we shouldn't spend
hospital money feeding him...

258
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,687
"but simply catch him
some flies."

259
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,143
We knew we had
a good story this time...

260
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,668
because it had everything in it.

261
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,181
It had romance.
It had suspense.

262
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,184
This fellow Zelig,
he grew up poor.

263
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,186
My city editor said, "Ted...

264
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,680
"we want this story
on page one every day."

265
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,684
In those days, you'd do anything
to sell papers.

266
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,698
To get a story,
you'd jazz it up...

267
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,132
you'd exaggerate,
play with the truth.

268
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,965
Here was a story.
It was a natural.

269
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,802
You told the truth,
and it sold papers.

270
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,671
It never happened before.

271
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,676
Overnight,
Leonard Zelig has become...

272
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,304
the main topic
of conversation everywhere...

273
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,315
and is discussed with amusement
and wonder.

274
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,807
No social gathering is without
its Leonard Zelig joke...

275
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,822
and in a decade
of popular dance crazes...

276
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,756
a new one
sweeps the nation.

277
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,766
What's brown, white,
and yellow with four eyes?

278
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,826
Leonard Zelig
at the League of Nations.

279
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,337
Not everyone, however...

280
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,897
was entranced
by the human chameleon...

281
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,806
and amongst the fanatics...

282
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,744
he was a handy symbol
of iniquity.

283
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,148
This creature
personifies Capitalist man.

284
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:03,644
A creature who takes
many forms to achieve ends...

285
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:09,184
the exploitation of the workers
by deception.

286
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,922
To the Ku Klux Klan, Zelig...

287
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,935
a Jew who was able
to transform himself...

288
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,496
into a Negro or Indian,
was a triple threat.

289
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,598
Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher...

290
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,109
certain that her findings
are correct...

291
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,612
begs for time
with her patient...

292
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,376
to put her theories
into operation.

293
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,976
You recall
the first time you began...

294
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:36,613
behaving like the people
you were around?

295
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,113
In school,
some very bright people...

296
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,128
asked me if I read "Moby Dick."

297
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,121
I was ashamed to say
I never read it.

298
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,634
And you pretended?

299
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,628
When did the changes
begin happening automatically?

300
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,664
Years ago.

301
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,175
Saint Patrick's Day.

302
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,077
I wandered into a bar.

303
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,139
Wasn't wearing green.

304
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,151
They made remarks.

305
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,153
I turned Irish.

306
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,655
You told them you were Irish?

307
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,648
My hair turned red.
My nose turned up.

308
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,719
Spoke about
the great potato famine...

309
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,028
and the little people.

310
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,035
We do not agree
with Dr. Fletcher's ideas.

311
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,596
We believe those ideas
are pipe dreams.

312
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,608
We believe that any change
in Zelig's condition...

313
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,110
is going to be brought about...

314
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,612
through certain
experimental drugs...

315
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,446
which although risky,
have been known to work wonders.

316
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,544
Zelig is treated
with the experimental drug...

317
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,714
somadril hydrate.

318
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,723
He undergoes
severe mood changes...

319
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:50,558
and for several days
will not come off the wall.

320
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,655
Then suddenly...

321
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,156
as Dr. Fletcher is beginning
to make some progress...

322
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,669
the question of Zelig's fate
takes a new twist...

323
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,606
as his half sister Ruth
removes him from the hospital.

324
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,600
"He can be better cared for
at home," she tells the doctors.

325
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:11,105
He'll be looked after by her
and her lover Martin Geist...

326
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,109
a businessman
and ex-carnival promoter.

327
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,123
There is very little resistance
amongst the doctors...

328
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,059
who are relieved to be rid
of the frustrating case.

329
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:26,053
Only Dr. Fletcher cares
about Zelig as a human being.

330
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,931
She insists he desperately needs
special care...

331
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,832
but it is to no avail.

332
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,828
No one was questioning
her legal right to Zelig.

333
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,842
She was his half sister
and his guardian...

334
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,902
but she had a strange
boyfriend called Geist.

335
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,905
He'd been in jail
for real-estate fraud.

336
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,817
He was selling
the same piece of property...

337
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,821
to a lot of people.

338
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,790
A Delaware Congressman
bought it twice.

339
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,792
The crowds
that line the roads...

340
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:59,286
to glimpse the human chameleon
tie up traffic for days.

341
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,323
He's a sight to behold
for tourists and children.

342
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,598
People from all over the country
fight for space...

343
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,105
to peek at this new wonderment.

344
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,017
Selling mementos
while her brother...

345
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,281
is allowed
to be on exhibition...

346
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,051
is only the beginning
for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist.

347
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,957
Admission is charged for
twice-daily demonstrations...

348
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,120
of Leonard's stunning prowess.

349
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,130
He does not disappoint...

350
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,133
changing appearance
over and over upon demand.

351
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,126
Overnight, he has become
an attraction, a novelty...

352
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,799
a freak.

353
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,970
In this 1935 film
based on the life of Zelig...

354
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:49,003
called "The Changing Man"...

355
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,015
the atmosphere
is best summed up.

356
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,018
We can't give up
custody of Leonard.

357
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,520
I know, if given the chance,
I can cure him.

358
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,718
Even our attorney
says it's hopeless.

359
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,693
Dr. Fletcher...
may I call you Eudora?

360
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,696
Somewhere behind
that vacuous face...

361
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,197
that zombielike stare...

362
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:10,099
is a real human being,
and I can bring it out.

363
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,295
How?

364
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,270
Some new way, some technique.

365
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,900
Whatever it is,
it will have to be personal.

366
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,410
There's not much
I can do legally.

367
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,912
They don't care.
They'll exploit him.

368
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,916
They see a chance to make money.

369
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,851
Look. They're selling
this Leonard Zelig doll.

370
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,854
The film did not exaggerate.

371
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,346
There weren't only Leonard Zelig
pens and lucky charms...

372
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,361
but clocks and toys,
watches and books...

373
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,626
and a famous Leonard Zelig doll.

374
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,257
There were aprons,
chameleon-shaped earmuffs...

375
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,632
and a popular
Leonard Zelig game.

376
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,675
There were many popular songs...

377
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:35,517
inspired by Leonard Zelig,
tunes that swept the nation.

378
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,642
In addition to
the products and endorsements...

379
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,046
there are
the endless exhibitions.

380
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,482
In Hollywood,
he's a great favorite...

381
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,146
and is offered a film contract.

382
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,156
Clara Bow invites him
for a private weekend...

383
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,954
and tells him to bring
all his personalities.

384
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:18,793
In Chicago, he meets heavyweight
champion Jack Dempsey...

385
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,799
who clowns with Zelig
at his training camp.

386
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,131
In Washington, D.C.,
he is introduced...

387
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,195
to both Calvin Coolidge
and Herbert Hoover.

388
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,208
In France, he is hailed
as Le Lezard.

389
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,803
He is the toast
of the Parisian music halls.

390
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,814
His performance endears him to
leading French intellectuals...

391
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:40,648
who see in him
a symbol for everything.

392
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,313
His transformation
into a rabbi...

393
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,823
is so realistic
that certain Frenchmen...

394
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,588
suggest he be sent
to Devil's Island.

395
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,088
At the Folies Bergere...

396
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,590
Josephine Baker does her version
of the Chameleon Dance...

397
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,536
and later tells friends...

398
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:03,371
she finds Zelig amazing,
but a little lost.

399
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,673
Everyone used to be
at my place...

400
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,179
everyone who was someone...

401
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:14,675
and occasionally
someone would bring Zelig in...

402
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,186
Leonard in.

403
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:20,681
Cole Porter
was fascinated by Leonard...

404
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,183
and he once
wrote a line in a song...

405
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:29,690
"You're the tops.
You're Leonard Zelig."

406
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:34,398
But then he couldn't find
anything to rhyme with Zelig.

407
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,072
I'm flying high

408
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,311
'Cause I've got a feeling
I'm falling

409
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:53,052
Falling for nobody else but you

410
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,854
You caught my eye

411
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,420
Now I got a feeling I'm falling

412
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:02,991
Show me that ring,
and I'll jump right through

413
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,629
I used to travel single, oh

414
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,936
We chanced to mingle, oh

415
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:14,503
Now I'm a-tingle over you

416
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:18,141
Hey, Mr. Zelig, stand by

417
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,482
'Cause I've got a feeling
I'm falling

418
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,150
Falling for nobody else but you

419
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,590
Wow!

420
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,094
Though the shows and parties...

421
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,620
keep Zelig's sister
and her lover rich and amused...

422
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,133
Zelig's own existence
is a nonexistence.

423
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,634
Devoid of personality...

424
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:42,129
his human qualities long since
lost in the shuffle of life...

425
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,142
he sits alone,
quietly staring into space...

426
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:50,136
a cipher, a nonperson,
a performing freak.

427
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,639
He who wanted only to fit in,
to belong...

428
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:57,644
to go unseen by his enemies
and be loved...

429
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:01,090
neither fits in nor belongs...

430
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:05,392
is supervised by enemies,
and remains uncared for.

431
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,958
The board at the hospital
has all but forgotten Zelig.

432
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,493
Only Dr. Fletcher continues
to fight for his custody.

433
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:17,065
The court turns
her final appeal down.

434
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,076
Throughout her valiant
legal battle...

435
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,308
she is frequently in the company
of her attorney Charles Koslow.

436
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,646
He falls in love with her...

437
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,744
and presses
for her hand in marriage.

438
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,254
She is ambivalent.

439
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,756
Reluctantly,
she is beginning to abandon...

440
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,352
all hope of recovering
Leonard Zelig.

441
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:41,195
That summer,
Geist has booked them in Spain.

442
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,668
It is the last leg
of a European tour...

443
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,694
that has been wildly successful.

444
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,707
Relations between Martin Geist
and Ruth Zelig...

445
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,709
have grown strained.

446
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,712
They have become bored
with one another...

447
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,213
and quarrel frequently.

448
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,705
The situation grows worse
when she meets Luis Martinez...

449
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,845
a mediocre
and cowardly bullfighter...

450
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,878
with whom she falls in love.

451
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,060
Though he wishes
to impress Ruth Zelig...

452
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:12,393
Martinez displays
his usual panic in the arena.

453
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,728
Good fortune is
with him, however...

454
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,132
as the bull gives himself
a brain concussion.

455
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,636
Martinez takes credit
for the kill...

456
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,969
and cutting off
the bull's ear...

457
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,805
presents it to his lover
with great bravado.

458
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,141
That evening,
in a jealous rage...

459
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,045
Martin Geist returns
to his hotel room...

460
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,174
and confronts Ruth Zelig.

461
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,277
He demands that she
give him the ear.

462
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,685
She refuses.

463
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,690
Geist insists upon
possession of the ear.

464
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,488
They quarrel furiously,
and Martinez is discovered...

465
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,654
hiding in the closet.

466
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,664
Geist pulls a revolver
and shoots him.

467
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:50,156
He turns the gun on Zelig's
half sister and kills her.

468
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,499
Then he takes his own life.

469
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,165
In an orgy
of jealous violence...

470
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,198
Leonard Zelig's life
is turned upside down.

471
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,856
At first, the news reverberates
around the world.

472
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,126
Then, just as quickly...

473
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:23,032
the thrill-hungry public
becomes apathetic.

474
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,662
Fresh scandals appear
and make headlines.

475
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,673
Events in the Jazz Age
move too rapidly...

476
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,766
like Red Grange.

477
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:35,303
A population glutted with
distractions is quick to forget.

478
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,906
The twenties come
to a crashing climax...

479
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,941
and still, Leonard Zelig
is nowhere to be found.

480
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:50,693
Dr. Eudora Fletcher
searches in vain to locate him.

481
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,197
When several leads
prove disappointing...

482
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,859
she gives up, discouraged.

483
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,697
I felt it was a shame.

484
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,704
Here was this unique case...

485
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,639
that I could make
my reputation on.

486
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,643
Not that I knew
how to cure him...

487
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,646
but if I could
have him alone...

488
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,138
and feel my way and be
innovative and creative...

489
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,152
I felt that I could
change his life...

490
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,814
if I only had the chance.

491
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:30,167
300,000 of the faithful are
waiting before St. Peter's...

492
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,533
for the appearance
of Pope Pius XI.

493
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,663
Borne on the shoulders
of twelve attendants...

494
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,675
the seat of the Adjustortoria
carrying the Holy Father...

495
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,677
is drawn out
to the central balcony...

496
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,078
where he bestows his
blessings on all the world.

497
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,674
This is the first time this
ritual has been performed...

498
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:50,677
in 63 years and brings
to a climax on Easter Sunday...

499
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,690
the religious ceremonies
of Holy Week.

500
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:56,182
What's this? A commotion
next to the Papal Father?

501
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,195
Somebody doesn't
belong up there.

502
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,197
The guards are summoned
amidst chaos...

503
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,199
as His Holiness Pope Pius XI...

504
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:05,202
tries to swat the intruder
with his sacred decree.

505
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,204
The faithful can't believe it.

506
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,365
It is, of course, Zelig.

507
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,875
He's returned
to the United States...

508
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,344
by Italian authorities...

509
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,473
and readmitted
to Manhattan Hospital.

510
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,678
I welcome this opportunity
to treat Leonard Zelig...

511
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:25,178
now that he is back
as a ward of the hospital.

512
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,681
I'm grateful the board
has given me this chance.

513
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,695
I sincerely hope
to return him to society...

514
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,697
a useful,
self-possessed citizen...

515
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:37,690
no longer a curiosity
with no life of his own.

516
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:41,535
Dr. Fletcher has no time now
to think of marriage.

517
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,440
All her attention must be
devoted to Leonard Zelig.

518
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:48,411
Her plan is to bring him
to her country home.

519
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:52,246
She will set up a neutral
environment away from society.

520
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:56,743
She will begin searching for
some new way to treat him...

521
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,586
in the hopes of penetrating
his unique malady.

522
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,684
Aware of the significance
of her work...

523
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,696
Eudora Fletcher arranges
to keep a filmed record...

524
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,698
of the proceedings.

525
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,691
For this, she contacts
her first cousin Paul Deghuee...

526
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:15,433
an inventor
and part-time photographer.

527
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:20,240
She said, "I want to make
a record of this case...

528
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,247
"for future generations
and the world of science.

529
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,249
"I want you to keep
the camera very quiet."

530
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:29,743
I said, "Why not just
take notes and write it up?"

531
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,755
She said, "Paul, when a man...

532
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,748
"changes his physical
appearance, you want to see it.

533
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,761
"You can't read about it.

534
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,491
"Besides which,
I am planning to make history."

535
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,625
The white room
is carefully arranged...

536
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,636
for maximum serenity.

537
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,128
It is a small study
in Dr. Fletcher's house...

538
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,141
sparsely furnished.

539
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:55,134
Clumsy photographic lights
are nailed to the wall...

540
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,842
to provide
sufficient illumination.

541
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:02,410
Microphones are hidden
in specially selected places.

542
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:05,718
The camera shoots
through a pane of glass...

543
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,884
which renders it
relatively unobtrusive.

544
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,759
The noise of the motor
is a problem.

545
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:15,255
This is muffled with a blanket
and anything else handy.

546
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,268
From this cramped
vantage point...

547
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,167
photographer Paul Deghuee
will record...

548
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,671
the famous
White Room Sessions...

549
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:25,938
a remarkable document
in the history of psychotherapy.

550
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,706
By today's standards...

551
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:31,704
the White Room Sessions
would seem very primitive...

552
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:35,207
and yet they were
really quite effective...

553
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,711
in developing a very strong
personal relation...

554
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,747
between doctor and patient.

555
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,228
The question whether
Zelig was a psychotic...

556
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,231
or merely extremely neurotic...

557
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:50,723
was a question
that was endlessly discussed...

558
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,736
among us doctors.

559
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:57,730
I myself felt that
his feelings were really...

560
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,676
not all that different
from the normal...

561
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,339
maybe what one would call...

562
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,678
the well-adjusted
normal person...

563
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,184
only carried
to an extreme degree...

564
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,186
to an extreme extent.

565
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,189
I myself felt that one could...

566
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:16,091
really think of him
as the ultimate conformist.

567
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,723
Leonard, do you know
why you're here?

568
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,704
To discuss psychiatry, right?

569
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,706
You're a doctor?

570
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,708
Yes, I am.

571
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,210
Perhaps you've read
my latest paper...

572
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,212
on delusional paranoia.

573
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:38,215
Turns out
the entire thing is mental.

574
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:43,710
Suppose I tell you
you're not a doctor.

575
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:49,216
I would say
that you're making a joke.

576
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,229
Incidentally, is it
always so bright in here?

577
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:56,222
I'm recording these sessions
on film, if you don't mind.

578
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,734
There's somebody
behind there, right?

579
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,670
That's right.
That's a camera.

580
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,175
Why don't we start
with simple reality.

581
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,177
Leonard, you're not a doctor.

582
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,682
You're a patient,
and I'm the doctor.

583
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:17,177
I wouldn't tell it to
too many people if I were you.

584
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,689
Leonard, you're not a doctor.

585
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,693
Is she going to be all right?

586
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,185
I've got to get back to town.

587
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,698
Really. I have
an interesting case...

588
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,201
treating two sets
of Siamese twins...

589
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,702
with split personalities.

590
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,466
I'm getting paid
by eight people.

591
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,906
"The first week's sessions
did not go too well..."

592
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,410
writes Dr. Fletcher
in her diary.

593
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,413
"Leonard identifies with me...

594
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,416
"and is convinced
that he is a doctor.

595
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,509
"He is guarded and suspicious.

596
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,419
"There is something
very appealing about him, too.

597
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,423
"He's quick-witted
and energetic.

598
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:56,257
"Perhaps it is his very
helplessness that moves me.

599
00:34:56,294 --> 00:35:00,355
"I must keep flexible
and play the situation by ear."

600
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,890
How are you today, Leonard?

601
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:09,863
Fine.
I got to get back to town soon.

602
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,375
I teach a course...

603
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,868
at the Psychiatric Institute
on masturbation.

604
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,380
I see.

605
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,383
I'm a doctor, and I...

606
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,385
Guilt-related masturbation.

607
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,388
Not guilt-related.
I teach advanced.

608
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,391
I'm quite
a respected doctor there.

609
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,893
Let your eyes follow this pen.

610
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,556
Just let yourself
breathe deeply.

611
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,225
Relax.

612
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,393
You're trying to hypnotize me.

613
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,404
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I mind. I'm a doctor.

614
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,406
You're not a doctor.

615
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,408
I am a doctor.

616
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,909
Just relax.

617
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,911
I can't.
I'm due back in town.

618
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,913
I have this
masturbation class.

619
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,882
If I'm not there,
they start without me.

620
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,942
As the weeks go by...

621
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,955
Dr. Fletcher grows
more and more frustrated.

622
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,890
"Leonard continues
to insist he is a doctor...

623
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,383
"and even refuses to let me
hypnotize him," she writes.

624
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,397
"I believe his experiences
of the past year...

625
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,229
"have made him
more defensive than ever.

626
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,633
"It is discouraging."

627
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,569
She was under great pressure.

628
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,573
You could tell.
She was moody and nervous.

629
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:21,340
He was fine, napping,
sitting in his chair reading.

630
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,348
He referred to himself
as Dr. Zelig.

631
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,907
He was reading
books on psychiatry.

632
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,409
I told her to get away
for a day and relax.

633
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,922
The strain was
becoming too much.

634
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,686
Leaving Zelig alone...

635
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,250
Dr. Fletcher takes
Paul Deghuee's advice...

636
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:41,425
and she and her fiance
spend some hours off, relaxing.

637
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:45,526
They go to Broadway, then
to a well-known nightclub...

638
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,936
where, despite
a lively stage show...

639
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,440
Dr. Fletcher
is distracted and uneasy.

640
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:54,376
She is unable to think
of anything but her patient.

641
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,438
The atmosphere with
her fiance Koslow is awkward.

642
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:01,884
He is put off by her
total obsession with Zelig.

643
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,377
Ironically, it is in the noisy,
smoke-filled atmosphere...

644
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,654
of the nightclub
that Eudora Fletcher...

645
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,890
is struck by a brilliant
and innovative plan...

646
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,921
that will create a major
breakthrough in the case.

647
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,908
Dr. Zelig.

648
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,901
I wonder if you could
help me with a problem.

649
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,914
I could certainly try.

650
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,416
Of course,
we can't promise anything.

651
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:38,912
Last week, I was with a group
of fairly erudite people...

652
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,925
who were discussing
the novel "Moby Dick."

653
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:46,953
I was afraid to admit
I hadn't read it, so I lied.

654
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:53,425
I want so badly to be liked...

655
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:57,464
to be like other people
so I don't stand out.

656
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,879
That's natural.

657
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:06,405
I go to such extreme
lengths to blend in.

658
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,381
You're a doctor. You should know
how to handle that.

659
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,395
But the truth
of the matter is...

660
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,921
I'm not an actual doctor.

661
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,426
You're not?

662
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,396
I've been pretending
to be a doctor...

663
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,910
to fit in with my friends.

664
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,935
You see, they're doctors.

665
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,441
That's something.

666
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:47,913
But you're a doctor,
and you can help me.

667
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,926
You have to help me.

668
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,418
I don't feel that well,
actually.

669
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:57,423
My whole life's just been a lie.

670
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:01,871
I've been posing
as one thing after another.

671
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,874
You need help, lady.

672
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:07,366
Last night, I dreamt I was
falling into fire.

673
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,379
What does that mean?

674
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,381
That's terrible.
I don't know.

675
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:16,182
Doctor, I know
I'm a complicated patient.

676
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,381
- I don't feel that well.
- What am I suffering from?

677
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,391
How should I know?
I'm not a doctor.

678
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,892
You're not?

679
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,896
- No. Am I?
- Who are you?

680
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,899
What do you mean?
These are tough questions.

681
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,400
Leonard Zelig?

682
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,402
Definitely. Who is he?

683
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,903
You.

684
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,906
I'm nobody. I'm nothing.

685
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,931
I... catch me.
I'm falling.

686
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,073
Playing on
Zelig's identity disorder...

687
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,080
Dr. Fletcher
has manipulated him...

688
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,911
into momentary disorientation.

689
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:49,443
With his guard lowered, she
quickly puts him under hypnosis.

690
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,385
Using posthypnotic suggestion...

691
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,858
she will now be able
to induce a trance at will.

692
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,884
My brother beat me.

693
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:01,887
My sister beat my brother.

694
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:07,393
My father beat my sister
and my brother and me.

695
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,896
My mother beat my father...

696
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,900
and my sister and me
and my brother.

697
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,914
The neighbors beat our family.

698
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:25,047
People down the block beat
the neighbors and our family.

699
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,922
I'm twelve years old.

700
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,927
I run into a synagogue.

701
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:35,421
I ask the rabbi
the meaning of life.

702
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:39,425
He tells me
the meaning of life...

703
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,439
but he tells it to me in Hebrew.

704
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,931
I don't understand Hebrew.

705
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:50,709
Then he wants to charge me
$600 for Hebrew lessons.

706
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:55,447
Dr. Fletcher's therapy consists
of a two-pronged attack.

707
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,445
In the trance state,
the personality will be...

708
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,390
deeply probed
and then restructured.

709
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,393
In the conscious state...

710
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,895
she will provide
love and affection...

711
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,921
unconditional positive regard.

712
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,924
You will be completely honest.

713
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,926
You're in a deep trance.

714
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,920
You will become not who you
think I want you to be...

715
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,933
but you will be yourself.

716
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,959
Now, how do you
feel about it here?

717
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,940
It's the worst.

718
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,443
I hate the country.

719
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,935
I hate the grass
and the mosquitos.

720
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,449
And cooking...

721
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,883
your cooking is terrible.

722
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,887
Your pancakes...

723
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:08,381
I dump them in the garbage
when you're not looking.

724
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,896
And the jokes
you try and tell...

725
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,390
when you think you're amusing
are long and pointless.

726
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,902
There's no end to them.

727
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,905
I see.

728
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,907
And what else?

729
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,934
I want to go to bed with you.

730
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,917
Well, that surprises me.

731
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,920
I didn't think you
liked me very much.

732
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,945
I love you.

733
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,426
You do?

734
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,428
You're very sweet...

735
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:49,922
because you're not as clever
as you think you are.

736
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:56,429
You're all mixed up and nervous,
and you're the worst cook.

737
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,941
Those pancakes...

738
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,376
I love you.

739
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,870
I want to take care of you.

740
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,906
No more pancakes.

741
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,223
I started out...

742
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,386
by trying to use Leonard
to make my reputation.

743
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:24,390
Then I found I had
very strong feelings for him.

744
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,903
I never thought
I was attractive.

745
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,905
I never had a real romance.

746
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,908
Charles Koslow
was the type of man...

747
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,433
my mother felt I should marry.

748
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,411
Feeling more confident
every day with her patient...

749
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,422
Dr. Fletcher takes him
for a cautious outing...

750
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,756
an afternoon at her sister's
house in nearby Teaneck.

751
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,920
Meryl Fletcher
is an aviatrix...

752
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,930
a fine professional pilot.

753
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,933
Eudora Fletcher
is an amateur pilot...

754
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,435
and the afternoon
is spent relaxing...

755
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,337
and retelling
old flying experiences.

756
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,875
As the weeks pass...

757
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,367
Zelig is encouraged
to open up more and more...

758
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,381
to give his own opinions.

759
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,384
What was guarded at first
soon becomes expansive.

760
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:18,946
I hated my stepmother.
I don't care who knows it.

761
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,425
I love baseball.

762
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,927
It doesn't
have to mean anything.

763
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,453
It's just very beautiful
to watch.

764
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,934
I'm a Democrat.
I always was a Democrat.

765
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:40,432
Is it OK if I don't agree
with you about that recording?

766
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,445
Of course.

767
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:46,609
Brahms is just always
too melodramatic for me.

768
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,448
You have to be
your own person...

769
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,954
and make your own
moral choices...

770
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,958
even when they do
require real courage.

771
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:59,156
Otherwise, you're like
a robot or a lizard.

772
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,892
Are you really going
to marry that lawyer?

773
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:04,423
I would much rather you didn't.

774
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,403
I don't agree.

775
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,430
I think this guy Mussolini
is a loser.

776
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:16,209
Are we ever going to make love?

777
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,873
It has been three months...

778
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,884
and the board wishes
to examine the patient.

779
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:24,877
Dr. Fletcher says Zelig isn't
ready to leave the premises.

780
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,390
The doctors agree
to visit him there.

781
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:30,393
The date is set...
four days hence.

782
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,395
If progress is insufficient...

783
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,420
she will be removed
from the case.

784
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,958
I was very nervous
because in his waking state...

785
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,972
he never remembered anything
from his trance state...

786
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,474
and I wondered
if there could be some way...

787
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,977
of locking
these two things together.

788
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,479
And then I also was worried...

789
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,483
that if he was
with strong personalities...

790
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,712
he might lose his personality.

791
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,051
Sunday at noon,
the doctors arrive.

792
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,556
They are greeted
by Eudora Fletcher...

793
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,550
and Leonard Zelig and are shown
around the grounds.

794
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,564
Though Dr. Fletcher
is tense and alert...

795
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,567
Leonard Zelig seems calm
and at ease.

796
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,059
Despite the fact that he
is surrounded by physicians...

797
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,572
he does not turn into one.

798
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,576
The encounter appears to be
a resounding success...

799
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,078
when Dr. Henry Mayerson
comments innocently...

800
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:26,071
about the weather,
saying that it is a nice day.

801
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,574
Zelig tells Dr. Mayerson
that he does not agree...

802
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,088
that it is a nice day.

803
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,090
Dr. Mayerson is taken aback...

804
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,524
at the firmness
of Zelig's conviction.

805
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,520
He points out that the sun
is shining and that it is mild.

806
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:45,023
Zelig, trained to voice his own
personal opinions fearlessly...

807
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,036
is too aggressive.

808
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,029
He has been molded too far
in the other direction.

809
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,042
He has become
over-opinionated...

810
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:57,012
and cannot brook any
disagreement with his own views.

811
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:00,574
I'd taken him too far
in the other direction.

812
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,586
He struck Dr. Mayerson
and several board members...

813
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,087
with a rake.

814
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,090
This wasn't what we wanted...

815
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,490
yet I felt I'd
accomplished something.

816
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:12,552
If I could have him
two more weeks...

817
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,064
I could do some fine-tuning...

818
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:18,192
and turn Leonard Zelig
back into his own man.

819
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,046
Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher,
the hero...

820
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:34,050
or should we say, heroine...
of the hour.

821
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,484
The beautiful and brilliant
young psychiatrist...

822
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,988
never lost faith
in her conviction...

823
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,990
that Leonard Zelig,
the human chameleon...

824
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,992
was suffering
from a mental disorder.

825
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,459
Working with her cousin...

826
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,088
cameraman Paul Deghuee,
the doctor managed...

827
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,098
to keep a vital record
of the proceedings...

828
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,499
including rare footage
of Zelig hypnotized.

829
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,562
The patient and healer
have become fast friends...

830
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,574
and enjoy
one another's company...

831
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,577
even when she's
not working on him.

832
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,580
The result of maintaining
a minority opinion...

833
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,707
is a resounding success
for psychiatry.

834
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,912
Who says women
are just good for sewing?

835
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,351
Now it's on to City Hall...

836
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,355
where the town's
newest celebrities...

837
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,084
are given the key to the city.

838
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,024
We're honored to present...

839
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,926
this key
to New York City to you.

840
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,534
Jimmy Walker
did want to be here...

841
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:29,062
and sing "Leonard the Lizard,"
but he was just too busy.

842
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,035
After city hall,
Eudora Fletcher...

843
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,477
the beautiful genius
who cured Zelig...

844
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,481
of his science-defying
condition...

845
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:42,474
is honored by fellow scientists
at New York's Waldorf-Astoria.

846
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,488
Present are luminaries
from all over the world...

847
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:48,491
not just in the field
of psychiatry...

848
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,494
but physics, biology,
mathematics, and you name it.

849
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,326
Here she is exchanging theories
with Nils Andersen...

850
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,855
the father
of modern blood disease.

851
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,425
Later in the week,
Dr. Fletcher is again honored...

852
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,438
as she gets to christen
her first ship.

853
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,373
Quite a success story
for a little girl...

854
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,967
from the backwoods.

855
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,415
I'm speaking to you...

856
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,009
from the home of
Mrs. Catherine Fletcher.

857
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:18,021
She's the mother
of Dr. Eudora Fletcher...

858
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:21,024
the famous psychiatrist
in the news these days.

859
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:25,017
I'll be asking Mrs. Fletcher...
to begin with...

860
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:28,031
to tell us something
about what it's like...

861
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,034
to raise a medical genius.

862
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:34,037
I might ask you about
the many sacrifices...

863
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:37,472
You've made to put your daughter
through medical school.

864
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,975
Speak right into
the microphones, please.

865
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,069
Sacrifices, we had none.

866
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:45,479
John was a stockbroker.
We had plenty of money...

867
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,983
and I came from a wealthy
Philadelphia family.

868
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,818
I'm sure that your daughter
always wanted to be a doctor...

869
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,982
ever since she could remember.

870
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,992
I don't think so.

871
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:59,484
I always thought she
wanted to be a flier...

872
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:02,498
like her sister Meryl,
and raise a family...

873
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,500
but she was a very moody child.

874
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:07,503
But a mother always
dreams for her child...

875
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:10,005
to have the success
your daughter has.

876
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,508
She was a very difficult girl.

877
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,510
Tell me about your husband.

878
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,011
I understand that he is
a simple businessman.

879
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:18,014
He must be so thrilled
and pleased...

880
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:22,007
to have his daughter
achieve such recognition.

881
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:25,510
John had problems... depression.
He drank.

882
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:28,524
Well, Mrs. Fletcher,
thank you so much...

883
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:31,391
for speaking with us today.

884
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,928
Here at San Simeon,
glorious dreamland...

885
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,566
of newspaper mogul
William Randolph Hearst...

886
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:48,669
celebrities from all walks
of society sun or play.

887
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,613
There's Marie Dressler
with Mr. Hearst.

888
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,617
Always a popular guest
at San Simeon...

889
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,610
Miss Dressler accepts a flower
from an ardent admirer.

890
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:01,624
Along with her is Marion Davies.

891
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:05,116
When she works, Miss Davies
is always dead serious...

892
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,630
But here,
at this fabulous playground...

893
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,656
She shows us her fun side.

894
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,261
There she is with
you-know-who... Charlie Chaplin...

895
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,363
always kidding.

896
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,534
Although New York
is 3,000 miles away...

897
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,444
Jimmy Walker appears through
Mr. Hearst's enchanted gateway.

898
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,041
Another New Yorker
is Leonard Zelig...

899
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,052
here shown clowning...

900
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,554
with everybody's
favorite cowboy... Tom Mix.

901
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,556
Won't Tony be jealous?

902
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,320
Tony is Tom's horse...

903
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,294
and we always thought
they went everywhere together.

904
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,593
There's that fellow
Chaplin again...

905
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:44,191
this time with Adolphe Menjou.

906
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:48,466
There's Claire Windsor
and Delores del Rio...

907
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:51,099
and a very charming
Eudora Fletcher...

908
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:54,110
chatting with Hollywood's
newest dancing sensation...

909
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,112
James Cagney.

910
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,614
And what have we here?

911
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,742
Only a beautiful lady
named Carole Lombard.

912
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,151
There's Dr. Fletcher
and Leonard Zelig...

913
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:08,647
hitting a few with Bobby Jones
on Mr. Hearst's golf course.

914
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:12,651
Unless Leonard can go back to
his old chameleon personality...

915
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:17,656
and turn into a golf pro,
I'd bet my money on Bobby.

916
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,693
But who cares,
if they're having fun?

917
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:31,072
Do you want to give the kids
of this country some advice?

918
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:34,572
I sure do.
Kids, you got to be yourself.

919
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,518
Don't act like anybody else...

920
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,454
because you think
they have all the answers.

921
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:43,585
Be your own man, speak up,
say what's on your mind.

922
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,596
Maybe they can't do that
in foreign countries...

923
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,598
but that's the American way.

924
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:52,591
I used to be a member
of the reptile family...

925
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,627
but I'm not anymore.

926
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,785
Zelig, no longer a chameleon,
is his own man.

927
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:46,277
His point of view
on politics, art, and love...

928
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:49,292
is honest and direct.

929
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:52,784
Though his taste is described
by many as lowbrow...

930
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,797
it is his own.

931
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,800
He is finally an individual,
a human being.

932
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,803
He no longer gives up
his own identity...

933
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:04,329
to be a safe part
of his surroundings.

934
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,342
His taste wasn't terrible.

935
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:09,345
He was a man who preferred
watching baseball...

936
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,347
to reading "Moby Dick"...

937
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:14,839
and that got him off
on the wrong foot...

938
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,852
or so the legend goes.

939
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:19,354
It was much more
a matter of symbolism.

940
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:22,358
To the Marxists
he was one thing.

941
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,860
The Catholic Church
never forgave him...

942
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,361
for the Vatican incident.

943
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,863
The American people...

944
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:31,355
in the throes of the Depression
as they were...

945
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:34,370
found in him a symbol
of possibility...

946
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,804
of self-improvement
and self-fulfillment.

947
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,809
And of course,
the Freudians had a ball.

948
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:43,301
They could interpret him
in any way they pleased.

949
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,314
It was all symbolism...

950
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:49,409
but no two intellectuals
agreed about what it meant.

951
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:52,012
I don't know if you can call it
a triumph of psychotherapy.

952
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:55,024
It's more like a triumph
of aesthetic instincts.

953
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,526
Dr. Fletcher's techniques
didn't owe anything...

954
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,028
to then-current schools
of therapy...

955
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,521
but she sensed what was needed
and provided it.

956
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,534
That was, in its way...

957
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,593
a remarkable
creative accomplishment.

958
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,197
When I think about it,
it seems to me his story...

959
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,698
reflected a lot of the
Jewish experience in America...

960
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:18,203
the great urge to push in
and to find one's place...

961
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,217
and then to assimilate
into the culture.

962
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,913
He wanted to assimilate
like crazy.

963
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,722
Eudora Fletcher's
life has also changed...

964
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,231
from this experience.

965
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,235
For her, fame and recognition
are empty rewards...

966
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:42,727
and do not live up
to the adolescent fantasies...

967
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,002
that prompted her ambition.

968
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,976
She and her patient
have fallen in love...

969
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,980
and it is no surprise
when she forsakes...

970
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,982
the upwardly-mobile
attorney Koslow...

971
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,179
and announces wedding plans
with Zelig.

972
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,636
It was wonderful to see
my sister and Leonard together.

973
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:58,135
She drew strength from him.

974
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:02,641
And they were so much in love
with each other...

975
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:07,145
and she looked happier
than she had in years.

976
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:12,651
I remember they decided
to get married in the spring...

977
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:16,688
and then, of course,
the roof fell in.

978
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,293
Two weeks before the wedding...

979
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,635
an ex-showgirl
named Lita Fox comes forth...

980
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:27,131
and claims that
she is married to Zelig.

981
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:30,635
She also claims
to have had his child.

982
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,672
It is an immediate scandal.

983
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,879
We were married a year ago.

984
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:43,382
He said he was an actor.
He sounded just like one.

985
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:45,394
I'm in show business, too.

986
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:48,397
We drove to Baltimore,
and we were married...

987
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,161
and I have a license
to prove it.

988
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,659
He had married her while under
a different personality.

989
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,172
When she read of the plans...

990
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,175
for his forthcoming wedding
to Eudora Fletcher...

991
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:02,736
she was mortified and
decided to take legal action.

992
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:05,680
Zelig says he will
fight it in court...

993
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:09,981
but public opinion begins
subtly to shift away from him.

994
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:14,149
Clever attorneys portray
Lita Fox as an abandoned woman.

995
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:18,627
The child is neglected, poor,
and fatherless.

996
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,596
Zelig has sold his life story
to Hollywood...

997
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,031
for a large sum of money.

998
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,092
When the scandal breaks...

999
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,603
the studio demands
its money back.

1000
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,937
Zelig can only return half.
The rest has been spent.

1001
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:35,411
Outraged, the studio gives him
half his life back.

1002
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,413
They keep the best moments.

1003
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:41,907
He is left with only his
sleeping hours and mealtimes.

1004
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:46,445
Zelig is shaken by the scandal,
but it is only the beginning.

1005
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,480
Now another woman
steps forward.

1006
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:52,655
Helen Gray, a salesgirl
from a Wisconsin gift shop...

1007
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:56,153
claims that Zelig
is the father of her twins.

1008
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:01,159
She tells lawyers that he passed
himself off as a fur trapper.

1009
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,672
Zelig has no recollection,
but admits...

1010
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:07,665
it could have happened
during one of his spells.

1011
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,837
It's the signal
for the floodgates to open.

1012
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:13,474
He married me
at the First Church of Harlem.

1013
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:16,314
He told me he was the brother
of Duke Ellington.

1014
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,844
He was the guy
who smashed my car up.

1015
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,857
It was brand-new.

1016
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,860
Then he backed up
over my mother's wrist.

1017
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:29,854
She's elderly
and uses her wrist a lot.

1018
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,834
He painted my house
a disgusting color.

1019
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,337
He said he was a painter.

1020
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:38,101
I couldn't believe the results.

1021
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,735
Then he disappeared.

1022
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,768
That Zelig
could be responsible...

1023
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,781
for the behavior of
each personality he assumed...

1024
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,477
means dozens of lawsuits.

1025
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50,952
He is sued
for bigamy, adultery...

1026
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:53,956
automobile accidents,
plagiarism, household damages...

1027
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,618
negligence, property damages...

1028
00:59:56,659 --> 01:00:00,220
and performing unnecessary
dental extractions.

1029
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,289
I would like to apologize
to everyone.

1030
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,302
I'm awfully sorry
for marrying all those women.

1031
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,304
It just... I don't know.

1032
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:11,307
It just seemed
like the thing to do.

1033
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:14,310
To the gentleman
whose appendix I took out...

1034
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,812
I don't know what to say.

1035
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,814
If it's any consolation...

1036
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,316
I may still have it
somewhere around the house.

1037
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:25,811
My deepest apology goes to
the Trokman family in Detroit.

1038
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:29,313
I never delivered
a baby before in my life...

1039
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:34,763
and I just thought that
ice tongs was the way to do it.

1040
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,597
Thriving mercilessly on
loopholes and technicalities...

1041
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:42,264
the American legal profession
has a field day.

1042
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,273
Zelig is branded a criminal.

1043
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,276
Despite Dr. Fletcher's
insistence that he cannot be...

1044
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,939
held responsible for actions
while in his chameleon state...

1045
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,413
it is no use.

1046
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:56,578
Leonard Zelig sets
a bad moral influence.

1047
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:59,588
America is a moral country.

1048
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:03,422
It's a God-fearing country.

1049
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:10,160
We don't condone scandals...
scandals of fraud and polygamy.

1050
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:16,934
In keeping with a pure society,
I say, lynch the little Hebe.

1051
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,975
Throughout
the humiliating ordeal...

1052
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:24,639
Eudora Fletcher stands by
the man she loves, valiantly.

1053
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,649
Privately, she tells friends...

1054
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,652
that she is worried about
Zelig's emotional condition...

1055
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,655
which seems to her
to be deteriorating...

1056
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:36,022
under the weight
of conservative moral opinion.

1057
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,960
In public, he tries to keep up
an appearance of composure...

1058
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:40,895
but it is increasingly
difficult.

1059
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,024
It is clear that
he is coming apart...

1060
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,525
when he and Eudora dine
at a Greek restaurant...

1061
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:52,633
and in the midst of the meal,
Zelig begins to turn Greek.

1062
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,616
He longs desperately
to be liked once again...

1063
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,585
to be accepted, to fit in.

1064
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,884
Public clamor over his morality
reaches a fever pitch...

1065
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:09,892
and on the eve
of his sentencing...

1066
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,156
Leonard Zelig vanishes.

1067
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:22,833
This is Chief Inspector
of Police Thomas Dowd...

1068
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:25,432
with a national
broadcasting news break.

1069
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:27,443
Leonard Zelig is missing.

1070
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,945
On the eve of his sentencing...

1071
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:33,073
for an assortment
of crimes and misdemeanors...

1072
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,914
ranging from polygamy to fraud,
he has disappeared.

1073
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,920
We are searching for clues...

1074
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,422
and would appreciate
speaking with anyone...

1075
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:44,256
who might have any information
leading to his apprehension.

1076
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:47,228
My sister was just shattered.

1077
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:52,223
She tried to keep up
a calm front...

1078
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,736
but she was just too upset.

1079
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,739
And she wasn't a person...

1080
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,742
who usually
displayed emotion easily...

1081
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,267
except where Leonard
was concerned.

1082
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:08,746
Dr. Fletcher and the police
confer daily.

1083
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,753
Together they make
public appeals...

1084
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,756
to anyone who might know
of his whereabouts.

1085
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,258
Apart from several
crank telephone calls...

1086
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,123
there is little response.

1087
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:21,597
Months go by,
and Zelig is not heard from.

1088
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,098
Cars are searched.

1089
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,930
False leads pour in
from everywhere.

1090
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,459
His jacket is recovered
in Texas.

1091
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,473
A manhunt in that state
proves futile.

1092
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:34,840
He is reported seen
in Chicago, in California.

1093
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:38,711
This still photo appears
to have a man resembling him...

1094
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,239
with a mariachi band in Mexico.

1095
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,746
Dr. Fletcher continues
to search for Zelig...

1096
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:50,759
but hopes fade
with each passing day.

1097
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:54,251
All I could think of
was Leonard...

1098
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,266
how much I missed him
and loved him...

1099
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,269
and all the terrific times
we'd spent together.

1100
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:03,966
It was really
a very painful time for me.

1101
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:08,500
The year ends,
and Zelig is still missing.

1102
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,315
I just moped around and wept.

1103
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,319
And one night
after a very bad time...

1104
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,821
my sister Meryl said to me...

1105
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,825
"Come on, let's go out
for dinner or a concert."

1106
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,818
I said, "No. I can't do it,"
but she insisted.

1107
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:30,196
We went out
and ended up in a movie.

1108
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:33,862
We saw "Grand Hotel," and
with it, there was a newsreel.

1109
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:46,738
Adolf Hitler and
the National Socialist Party...

1110
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,751
continue to consolidate gains
in depression-ridden Berlin.

1111
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:52,083
Denouncing
the Treaty of Versailles...

1112
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:55,852
the Nazis make fervent appeals
to German patriotism...

1113
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,760
Eudora Fletcher is stunned
by what she sees.

1114
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:01,763
Amongst the brown shirts...

1115
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,766
she spots a figure
who could be Zelig.

1116
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,258
Then it made all
the sense in the world...

1117
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:11,273
because although
he wanted to be loved...

1118
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,275
craved to be loved...

1119
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,777
there was also
something in him...

1120
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:19,907
that desired immersion
in the mass and anonymity.

1121
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:23,214
And Fascism offered Zelig
that kind of opportunity...

1122
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:27,712
so that he could make something
anonymous of himself...

1123
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:32,421
by belonging
to this vast movement.

1124
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:35,953
She sails for
Europe the following week.

1125
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,967
Ten days later,
she arrives in Berlin.

1126
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:43,461
Germany is a country deep
in the throes of the Depression.

1127
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:47,033
Militarism and unrest
are in the air.

1128
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,601
She searches everywhere
and makes inquiries...

1129
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,135
but it is impossible.

1130
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,579
After three weeks...

1131
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,083
the authorities begin
to get suspicious.

1132
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,584
They watch her.

1133
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:00,077
While she is out,
they search her hotel room.

1134
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,056
A fourth week goes by...

1135
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,491
and she is about
to give up and go home...

1136
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:08,987
when news of a large rally
at Munich catches her attention.

1137
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,999
It is rumored
that it will be...

1138
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:14,002
the largest gathering to date
of Nazi personnel.

1139
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,334
Eudora Fletcher
is counting on the hope...

1140
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:21,605
that Zelig may attend and that
if she can confront him...

1141
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:26,274
the strong feeling he has always
had for her can be awakened.

1142
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,806
At first, all appears hopeless.

1143
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,842
The crowd is huge.

1144
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:34,481
It seems impossible to locate
any one particular face.

1145
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:52,274
Then suddenly, a figure flanking
the chancellor...

1146
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:54,003
catches her attention.

1147
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:58,673
Behind and to the right
of Hitler, she spots Zelig.

1148
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:02,775
Struggling to make contact,
she manages to catch his eye.

1149
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:07,312
Like a man emerging
from a dream, Zelig notices her.

1150
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:11,816
In a matter of seconds,
everything comes back to him.

1151
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,812
It was nothing like
it happened in the movie.

1152
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:17,417
When Leonard left the podium,
they didn't know what to think.

1153
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,485
We couldn't believe our eyes.

1154
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,496
Hitler's speech was ruined.

1155
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:25,330
He wanted to make
a good joke about Poland...

1156
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:29,827
but just then,
Zelig interfered...

1157
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:33,831
and Hitler was extremely upset.

1158
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:39,781
The SS wanted to grab Zelig...

1159
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:42,784
but if they would have
grabbed him...

1160
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,787
they probably would have
tortured him...

1161
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,289
or maybe even shot him.

1162
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:49,791
So in the confusion...

1163
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:53,283
Fletcher and Zelig
got out of the building...

1164
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,297
through a side door.

1165
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:58,789
They grabbed a car,
sped away in the car...

1166
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:01,667
and the SS after them,
shot them.

1167
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,730
In rare
German newsreel footage...

1168
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,765
a quick glimpse of the escape
was recorded.

1169
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,759
I was flying.
It was wonderful.

1170
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,261
And then suddenly,
something happened.

1171
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,764
I was frightened.
I lost control.

1172
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:31,766
We went into a dive.

1173
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,032
Leonard was so terrified that
he changed his personality...

1174
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:40,030
and before my eyes,
because I was a pilot...

1175
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:42,270
he turned into one, too.

1176
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:45,075
Zelig takes control
of the airplane.

1177
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,082
Acting the role of pilot...

1178
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:49,676
he struggles valiantly
with the aircraft.

1179
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:53,745
The Germans, who are stunned,
take a full fifteen minutes...

1180
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:56,622
before following
in hot pursuit of their quarry.

1181
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,752
With Eudora Fletcher
unconscious...

1182
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:01,763
Zelig, who had never flown
before in his life...

1183
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,265
not only escapes
the German pilots...

1184
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,259
but sets a record for flying
nonstop across the Atlantic...

1185
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:09,794
upside down.

1186
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,394
With a storm of cheers
and a blizzard of ticker tape...

1187
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:36,227
New York welcomes back
Eudora Fletcher...

1188
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,893
and Leonard Zelig,
the human chameleon.

1189
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:42,927
His remarkable feat of aviation
fills the nation with pride...

1190
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:45,600
and earns him
a full presidential pardon.

1191
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:47,302
Forgiving multitudes
flock to see him...

1192
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,278
as he sits by the side
of his plucky bride-to-be.

1193
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:52,371
Their journey of triumph
leads to City Hall.

1194
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:55,383
New York's greatest honor,
the Medal of Valor...

1195
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,386
is bestowed on Zelig
by Carter Dean.

1196
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:03,357
You are a great inspiration
to the young of this nation...

1197
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,860
who will one day grow up...

1198
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:08,863
and be great doctors
and great patients.

1199
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,873
This was a great thrill.

1200
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:21,876
I'm glad we lived
to see this day.

1201
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,879
Right. I've never flown
before in my life...

1202
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:27,882
and it shows exactly
what you can do...

1203
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,907
if you're a total psychotic.

1204
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,157
The thing was paradoxical...

1205
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:40,650
because what enabled him to
perform this astounding feat...

1206
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:44,325
was his ability
to transform himself.

1207
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:49,326
Therefore, his sickness was also
at the root of his salvation...

1208
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:53,330
and I think it's interesting
to view the thing that way.

1209
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:59,473
It was his very disorder
that made a hero of him.

1210
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:02,575
It was really absurd in a way.

1211
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:05,587
I mean, he had
this curious quirk...

1212
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:07,418
this strange characteristic.

1213
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:09,924
And for a time,
everyone loved him...

1214
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,426
and then people
stopped loving him.

1215
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:15,430
Then he did this stunt
with the airplane...

1216
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,932
and then everybody
loved him again.

1217
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:20,935
And that was what
the twenties were like.

1218
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:24,666
When you think about it,
has America changed so much?

1219
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:26,675
I don't think so.

1220
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:31,339
After untangling
countless legal details...

1221
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,838
Leonard Zelig
and Eudora Fletcher marry.

1222
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:39,115
It is a simple ceremony
captured on home movies.

1223
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:02,103
"Wanting only to be liked,
he distorted himself...

1224
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,772
"beyond measure,"
wrote Scott Fitzgerald.

1225
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:07,941
"One wonders what would have
happened if at the outset...

1226
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:12,943
"he had had the courage to speak
his mind and not pretend.

1227
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:17,084
"In the end, it was, after all,
not the approbation of many...

1228
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:21,961
"but the love of one woman
that changed his life."
