1
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,413
God, she's beautiful.

2
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,418
She's got the prettiest eyes...

3
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,353
and she looks so sexy
in that sweater.

4
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,856
I just want to be
alone with her...

5
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,859
and hold her and kiss her...

6
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,191
and tell her
how much I love her...

7
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,026
and take care of her...

8
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,531
Stop it, you idiot.

9
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,862
She's your wife's sister.

10
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,697
But I can't help it.

11
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,362
I'm consumed by her.

12
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,030
It's been months now.

13
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,539
I dream about her.

14
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,872
I think about her at the office.

15
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,377
Oh, Lee...

16
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,879
what am I going to do?

17
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,212
I hear myself
mooning over you...

18
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,718
and it's disgusting.

19
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,880
Before, when she squeezed
past me in the doorway...

20
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,016
and I smelled that perfume
on the back of her neck...

21
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,687
Jesus, I thought
I was going to swoon.

22
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,889
Easy.

23
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,228
You're a dignified
financial adviser.

24
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,393
It doesn't look good
for you to swoon.

25
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,402
Elliot?

26
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:53,428
Sweetheart,
have you tried these?

27
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,408
They're wonderful.
Holly and her friend made them.

28
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,739
They're fantastic.

29
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,904
Your sister
is an unbelievable cook.

30
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,847
I know.
She has all the cooking charm.

31
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,043
You've got talent as well.

32
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,449
I've eaten five of these.

33
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,351
Holly, why don't you
open a restaurant?

34
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,855
We practically are.

35
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,687
Well, not a restaurant, but...

36
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,523
April and I are going to do
some catering.

37
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,689
- You're kidding.
- No. We decided.

38
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,027
Perfect.

39
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,192
We like to cook
for our friends...

40
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:25,637
so until an acting job comes,
we could do private parties.

41
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,537
Great idea.
That's where your talent lies.

42
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,042
I know. Get out.

43
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,873
Can I speak to you privately?

44
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,277
I'm her husband.
She tells me anything.

45
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,880
Hannah, I have to borrow
some more money.

46
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,384
- Don't get upset.
- Lt never upsets me.

47
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,217
This is the last time.
I'm keeping strict accounts.

48
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,722
Holly, please, don't insult me.

49
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,223
Someday
I'll pay back everything.

50
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,716
- I know. How much?
- $2,000.

51
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:53,221
April and I have this catering
idea that'll be great.

52
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,063
You admit we're great cooks,
right?

53
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,899
To get started,
there's things I have to buy...

54
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,063
and some old debts.

55
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,006
Tell me one thing.
Are we talking cocaine again?

56
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,508
I swear. I swear.

57
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,171
We've already got requests
to do some dinner parties.

58
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,010
Obviously I'm not going to be
a caterer forever.

59
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,515
We both still audition.

60
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,018
Something could come up
at any moment.

61
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,520
My days are free
for my acting class.

62
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,046
I haven't done drugs in a year.

63
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,718
A whimpering

64
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,748
Simpering

65
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,023
Child again

66
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,529
Bewitched

67
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,590
Bothered and bewildered

68
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,035
Mom and Dad are floating down
memory lane again.

69
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,538
- Tried the shrimp?
- Fantastic.

70
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,040
You've outdone yourself.

71
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,872
I need an antihistamine.
Mom's feeling her asthma...

72
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,378
so before she turns
into a comedian...

73
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,880
She's a comedian
when she gets up.

74
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,211
At least she isn't drinking.

75
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,376
Doesn't she look great
in that new dress?

76
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,886
She knows it, too,
'cause she's flirting.

77
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,388
Maybe when she's 80, she'll
stop straightening her garter.

78
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,391
She's got a garter belt.

79
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,722
Where's the antihistamine?

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,218
Ask Elliot.
He's got them somewhere.

81
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,060
Frederick didn't come with her.

82
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,656
When does Frederick ever come?

83
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,828
He's such an angry...
such a depressive.

84
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,361
I thought she was moving out.

85
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,570
A pill, he is

86
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,170
But still he is

87
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:18,912
All mine and I'll keep him
until he is

88
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,976
Bewitched

89
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,648
Watch out, you guys.

90
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,157
The kids are so adorable.

91
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,318
It gets so lonely on holidays.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,988
That's why
I invited Phil Gamisch.

93
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,497
Hannah, he's such a loser.

94
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,999
He's not a loser.

95
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,160
He's the headmaster
at Daisy's school.

96
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,170
He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.

97
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,672
His Adam's apple jumps
up and down when he's excited.

98
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,607
He's a lot better
than your ex... husband.

99
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,837
He's got a good job.
He's not a dope addict.

100
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,174
Give me a break.

101
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,180
Am I interrupting
any sister talk?

102
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,681
Come in!

103
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,174
There are no interesting
single men at this party.

104
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,686
It's terrible.

105
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,349
Maybe April would like Phil.
Tall guy.

106
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,621
I met Phil.
Looks like Ichabod Crane?

107
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,628
I love that.
That's my type.

108
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,630
I don't believe it.

109
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,791
Really,
we mustn't get discouraged.

110
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,633
Hannah will invite some men who
don't look like Ichabod Crane.

111
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,967
If not this Thanksgiving...

112
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,472
maybe at Christmas
or New Year's.

113
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,374
If not this New Year's,
maybe next New Year's.

114
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,172
Must be here someplace.

115
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,148
I love that book you lent me...
"The Easter Parade."

116
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,151
You were right. It had
very special meaning for me.

117
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,483
How's Frederick?
He didn't come.

118
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,489
You know, one of his moods.

119
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,981
Although it wasn't a bad week.
He sold a picture.

120
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:37,325
One of his better drawings,
a very beautiful nude study.

121
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,990
Actually, it was of me.

122
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,158
It's a funny feeling to know...

123
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,668
you're being hung naked
in some stranger's living room.

124
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,671
But you can't tell
it's me, although...

125
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,536
You're turning all red, Elliot.

126
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,507
Really?

127
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,170
So what else?
What are you up to?

128
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,508
I don't know.

129
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,843
My unemployment's running out.

130
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,475
I was thinking of taking
some courses at Columbia.

131
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,677
Like?

132
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,117
I don't know, exactly.

133
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,620
Sociology, psychology maybe...

134
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,452
I always thought I'd like
to work with children.

135
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,459
I always have clients
who are furnishing places.

136
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,462
Some might be interested
in buying art.

137
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,963
Shall I call you?

138
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,124
Sure.

139
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,634
Frederick would really
be grateful for a sale.

140
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,693
Dinner's ready.

141
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,035
You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look pretty?

142
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,438
I bumped into your ex... husband
the other day.

143
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,967
He's as crazy as ever. He was
going to get a blood test.

144
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,309
Mickey's such a hypochondriac.

145
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,644
How would he handle
a real illness?

146
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,707
Let's go have dinner.

147
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,078
Ladies and gentlemen...

148
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,315
Dad...

149
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,217
No. Now...

150
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,418
We're starving.

151
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,620
This is a toast...

152
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,992
Take the wine away.

153
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,656
This is a toast.

154
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,666
You know, this beautiful
Thanksgiving dinner...

155
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,158
was all prepared by Hannah.

156
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,662
A little help from Mary,
also Holly and April...

157
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:58,165
You did it.

158
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:02,614
And we drink to her,
and we all congratulate her...

159
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,448
on her wonderful accomplishment
during this last year...

160
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,786
her great success
in "A Doll's House."

161
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,950
Bravo! Bravo!

162
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,619
I played Nora...

163
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,460
I hate to tell you what year...
and it's very difficult...

164
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,126
to behave like Torvald's
little chipmunk...

165
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,625
without making a perfect ass
out of yourself.

166
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,630
I think that lbsen would have
been damn proud of our Hannah.

167
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,802
Speech!

168
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,142
I've been very, very lucky.

169
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,638
When I had the kids,
I decided to stop working...

170
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,651
and devote myself
to the family...

171
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,152
and I've been very happy...

172
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,156
but I've always hoped
that maybe some little gem...

173
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,648
would come along and tempt me
back on the stage.

174
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,662
So now I got that
out of my system...

175
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,995
and I can go back to
what makes me happiest.

176
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,501
Bravo!

177
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,645
Is it my imagination...

178
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,276
or does Elliot have
a little crush on me?

179
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,446
It's funny.
I've had that thought before.

180
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,116
He pays attention to me
all the time...

181
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,957
and he blushed tonight when
we were alone in the bedroom.

182
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,462
I wonder if he and Hannah
are happy.

183
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,465
It's funny.

184
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,991
I still feel a little buzz
from his flirting.

185
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,642
Want some coffee or tea?

186
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,143
No, thank you.

187
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,644
How about something to eat?

188
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,976
Nothing.

189
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,480
Are you sure?

190
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,482
Absolutely.

191
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,144
What am I going to do with you?

192
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,652
God...

193
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,655
And why didn't you
come tonight?

194
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,657
We all had a terrific time.

195
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,988
You would have enjoyed yourself.

196
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,822
I'm going through a period...

197
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,488
where I just can't
be around people.

198
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,327
I didn't want to abuse anyone.

199
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,833
You wouldn't.
They're all so sweet.

200
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,663
You're the only person
I can be with...

201
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,003
who I really look forward
to being with.

202
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,667
You're too harsh with everyone.

203
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,700
You know that, don't you?

204
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,673
Isn't it enough
that I can love you?

205
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,342
You're such a puzzle...

206
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,342
so sweet with me and so
contemptuous of everyone else.

207
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:26,188
There was a time when you
were happy to be only with me.

208
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,693
You wanted to learn everything
about poetry, music.

209
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,697
Have I taught you
everything I have to give?

210
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,221
I don't think so.

211
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,700
Elliot said he might have
a couple of clients for you.

212
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,700
I'm sure those morons he handles
have deep feelings for art.

213
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,042
You never know.

214
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,876
He was just being nice.

215
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,279
Because he likes you.

216
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,476
Me?

217
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,712
Elliot lusts after you.

218
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,551
Based on what?
You never even see him.

219
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,556
Based on...

220
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,887
whenever you see him...

221
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,983
you come home with
books he's recommended...

222
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,154
or films you must see or...

223
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,163
He's my sister's husband.

224
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,325
If you gave him half a chance,
you'd like him.

225
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,664
He's very intelligent.

226
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,160
He's a glorified accountant,
and he's after you.

227
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,673
And I prefer to sell my work...

228
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,667
to people who appreciate it,
not to rock stars.

229
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,940
Understand?

230
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,684
They won't let us do the sketch?

231
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,192
They think it's too dirty.

232
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,523
They saw the rehearsal.

233
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,859
Did they figure out
what the words mean?

234
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,865
Mickey, it's a half hour to air.

235
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,197
We're short.
The show's five minutes short.

236
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,496
How can it be?

237
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,697
Without the sketch,
we're ten minutes short.

238
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,706
How can they do that?

239
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,708
It's because
our ratings are low.

240
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,868
Migraine.

241
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,879
We better go
to Ronnie's dressing room.

242
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,381
This kid must've taken
1,600 Quaaludes.

243
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,712
He can't go on.

244
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,047
Why me, Lord?

245
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,313
What did l...

246
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,649
Standards and practices?

247
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,484
Why suddenly
is the sketch dirty?

248
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,649
Child molestation
is a touchy subject.

249
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,159
Read the papers.
Half the country's doing it.

250
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,491
But you name names.

251
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,962
We don't name names.
We say, "The Pope."

252
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,487
That sketch cannot go on.

253
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,332
Who changed my sketch
about the P.L.O.?

254
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,667
I had to cut four lousy lines.

255
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,172
The whole premise is ruined.

256
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,505
You're crazy.
It's not so delicate.

257
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,839
I don't care!

258
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,335
I don't want anyone tampering
without telling me.

259
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,678
You want them cut,
I'll cut them myself.

260
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,617
Listen, instead of
the child... molestation sketch...

261
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,017
why don't we repeat...

262
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,682
the Cardinal Spelling/Ronald
Reagan homosexual dance number?

263
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,190
I don't feel good.

264
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,693
What did you do,
swallow a drugstore?

265
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,194
I lost my voice.

266
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,355
Jesus...

267
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,524
Ronnie, you have to go on
in twenty... five minutes.

268
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,865
Does anybody got a Tagamet?
My ulcer's killing me.

269
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,463
You want a Quaalude?

270
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,701
Christ, this show's
ruining my health.

271
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,710
Meanwhile, my ex... partner
moves to California...

272
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,644
and every stupid show
he produces...

273
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,147
turns out to be a big hit.

274
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,151
Brother, what am I
going to do with my life?

275
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,652
Speaking of that...

276
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:11,679
I got to remember
to see my ex... wife tomorrow.

277
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,658
Glad you could
put in an appearance.

278
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,163
I got two minutes.

279
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,497
The show's killing me.
I got a million appointments.

280
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,163
I got to see new
comedians later...

281
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,172
Two minutes
on your sons' birthday.

282
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,174
Happy birthday, fellas.

283
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,676
Hey, guys, look.
Daddy brought presents.

284
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,178
A little hug.
What is this?

285
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,181
How about some action
from the kids?

286
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,512
How is everything?

287
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,847
Everything's good.
Everything's fine.

288
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,511
Open the presents now.

289
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,918
Let's see some reaction.

290
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,114
How's Elliot?

291
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,315
He's fine.

292
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,189
I'm trying to convince him
to produce a play.

293
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,693
Really? That'll be terrific.

294
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,195
I like him.
He's a sweet guy.

295
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,857
Isn't that a great mitt?

296
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,195
'Cause he's a loser.

297
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,201
He's awkward and clumsy like me.

298
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,204
I always like an underconfident
person, you know?

299
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,138
He's been wanting a mitt.

300
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,142
You've always had
good taste in husbands.

301
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,473
That's a beauty.

302
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,979
Go out over there.
Come on, hurry up.

303
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,743
Go out by the Sung vase
and catch this.

304
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,274
Watch the...

305
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,946
Hannah's sweet.

306
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,649
Sometimes I still get angry
when I think of things.

307
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,987
What the hell.

308
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,492
At least I'm not paying
child support.

309
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,486
I hope there's nothing
physically wrong with me either.

310
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,522
So what's the problem this time?

311
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,194
This time I really think
I have something.

312
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,363
It's not like
that adenoidal thing...

313
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,033
where I didn't know I
had them out when I was younger.

314
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,044
I saw your father
this week about his sinus.

315
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,375
He complained of chest pains.

316
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,381
This guy's the real
hypochondriac of the family.

317
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,713
He mentioned that
you'd had some dizziness.

318
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,879
A little dizziness,
and I think I'm developing...

319
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,719
a hearing loss
in my right ear... left ear.

320
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,054
Sorry. My right...

321
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,889
Right or left. I can't remember.

322
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,326
Let's take a look.

323
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,683
You have had
a significant drop...

324
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,777
in the high decibel range
of your right ear.

325
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,185
Really?

326
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,022
Have you been exposed to a loud
noise recently, or a virus?

327
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,686
I've been perfectly healthy.

328
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,696
You know me...
I always imagine I have things.

329
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,857
When did you first notice this?

330
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,697
About a month ago.
What do I have?

331
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,202
You've had dizzy spells.

332
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,695
What about ringing and buzzing?
You notice any of that?

333
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,200
Now that you mention it,
I have buzzing and also ringing.

334
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,873
Ringing and buzzing.
Am I going deaf?

335
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,711
It's just in one ear.

336
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,708
Is it healthier
to have problems in both ears?

337
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,722
I'd like to make an appointment
at the hospital...

338
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,156
and have them run some tests.

339
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,490
The hospital?
What kind of tests?

340
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,155
Don't get alarmed.

341
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,823
These are just
more sophisticated...

342
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,332
audiometry tests
than I can run here.

343
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,664
It's nothing.

344
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,170
Then why go to the hospital
at all?

345
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,671
I hear perfectly fine.

346
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,164
I'm weak in the high decibels,
so I'll skip the opera.

347
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,176
Don't panic.

348
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,178
I just want to rule out
some things.

349
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,440
Like what?

350
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,278
It's nothing.
Will you trust me?

351
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,877
Hello, Dr. Wilkes?
This is Mickey Saxe.

352
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,751
I want to ask a question.

353
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,619
Sure, Mickey. What's up?

354
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,888
If you have
a hearing loss in one ear...

355
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,385
and it's not from a virus
or a loud noise...

356
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,261
what are the possibilities?

357
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,063
Anything. Often it's hereditary.

358
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,265
Flu... even a small noise
will do it.

359
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,136
Right, but nothing worse?

360
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:53,201
I guess the dark side of
the spectrum is a brain tumor.

361
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,874
Really?

362
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,907
Here's the new pages.

363
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,350
Wait. Did cards get these?

364
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,683
Not yet.

365
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,017
Let's hope it's good.

366
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,522
Really.

367
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,423
We'll be down in a minute.

368
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,019
What's the matter with you?
You're all white.

369
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,860
I feel dizzy.
I don't feel well.

370
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,365
Do you hear a ringing?

371
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,197
Is there a ringing sound?

372
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,702
I hear it.

373
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,203
Not that.

374
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,866
We're going to be
working late tonight.

375
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,374
We'll order out.

376
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,867
Jesus, if I have a brain tumor,
I don't know...

377
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,710
You don't.
He didn't say you did.

378
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,716
Naturally they won't tell you...

379
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,218
because sometimes
the weaker ones will panic.

380
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,720
But not you.

381
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,222
Do you hear a buzzing?

382
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,055
Come on. We got a show to do.

383
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,560
I can't keep focused.

384
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,721
But there's nothing
wrong with you.

385
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,732
Then why does he want
to run more tests?

386
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,700
He has to rule out
certain things.

387
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,895
Like what?

388
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,403
I don't know. Cancer.

389
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,238
Don't say that.
I don't want to hear that word.

390
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,402
But you don't have any symptoms.

391
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,675
I got the classic symptoms
of a brain tumor.

392
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,341
Two months ago
it was a malignant melanoma.

393
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,645
Naturally.

394
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,847
The sudden appearance
of a black spot on my back...

395
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,354
It was on your shirt.

396
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,857
How was I to know?
Everyone was pointing.

397
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,359
We've got to make
some booking decisions.

398
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,021
I can't. I can't think.

399
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,189
This morning I was so happy.

400
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,028
I don't know what went wrong.

401
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,863
You were miserable this morning.

402
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,028
We got bad reviews,
terrible ratings...

403
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,367
the sponsors are furious.

404
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,432
I was happy, but I just
didn't realize I was happy.

405
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,972
These things are delicious.
What in the world are they?

406
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,484
Those are quail eggs.
Aren't they good?

407
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,316
My friend April makes those.

408
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,946
Here, try a shrimp puff.

409
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,217
I make those.

410
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,451
Thanks.

411
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,684
Excuse me.

412
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:50,922
Thank you.

413
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,394
The stroganoff is ready.

414
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,899
We're a big hit.

415
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,333
Yesterday, I auditioned
for "Come Back, Little Sheba."

416
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,337
That wasn't such a big hit.

417
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,430
You'll get five jobs next week.

418
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,101
Excuse me.
Are there any more clams?

419
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,770
A few. You like them?

420
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,778
Can't resist.

421
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,779
How flattering.

422
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,940
Did you try the shrimp puffs?

423
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,610
You guys are too attractive
to be caterers.

424
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,618
We're actresses.

425
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,449
Is this your first job?

426
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,954
Is the food that bad?

427
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,286
Not at all.

428
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,450
We need more sauce
for the lasagna.

429
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,955
I know. You're an actress
with a flair for shrimp puffs.

430
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,965
The shrimp puffs are Holly's.

431
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,466
I do the crepes caviar.

432
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,469
And the quail's responsible
for the quail eggs.

433
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,472
I stole you
a couple of extra clams.

434
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,973
Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin.

435
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,805
April Knox. Hi.

436
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,969
You're Holly.

437
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,310
We're the Stanislavski
Catering Company.

438
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,144
Now I'll tell you the truth.

439
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,016
I came in because
I was bored stiff by the party.

440
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,986
What makes you think
we're more interesting?

441
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,989
Actually, I'm going
to listen to Aida...

442
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,888
if I'm not in your way.

443
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,153
Not at all.

444
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,186
We saw Pavarotti and Arnani
at the Met, and I cried.

445
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,822
I cry at the opera.

446
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,323
I go limp in the last scene
in "La Traviata."

447
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,335
Me, too.

448
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,996
I have a box at the Met.

449
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,006
I bring my bottle of wine...

450
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,838
I watch, and I cry.
It's disgusting.

451
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,173
What do you do?

452
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,508
I'm an architect.

453
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,842
What do you build?

454
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,211
Are you really interested?

455
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,040
What time do you get off?

456
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,853
It's the red one?

457
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,480
Oh, it's magnificent.

458
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,320
The design's deliberately
noncontextual...

459
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,657
but I wanted to keep
the atmosphere of the street...

460
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,994
on the proportions
and in the material.

461
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,498
That's unpolished red granite.

462
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,000
Is that what...

463
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,798
It has an organic quality.

464
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,997
Right.

465
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,165
Almost entirely,
wholly interdependent...

466
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,675
if you know what I mean.

467
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,678
I can't put it into words.

468
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,680
The important thing is,
it breathes.

469
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,172
You know, people pass by
vital structures all the time...

470
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,186
and they never take the time
to appreciate them.

471
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,847
You tune into your environment.

472
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,685
It's really important.

473
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,624
What are your favorite
buildings, David?

474
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,126
You want to see some?

475
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,424
Let's do it.

476
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,607
It's just so romantic.

477
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,634
I want to put on a gown
and open the French doors...

478
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,839
It's French.

479
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,347
It is. It's romantic...

480
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,839
and it's got a handsome partner
sitting right beside it...

481
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,685
and your eye goes along, lulled
into complacency, and then...

482
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,122
- That's just...
- Look at this.

483
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,956
That's disgusting.
That's really terrible.

484
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,292
- Really sad.
- And it ruins everything else.

485
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,490
It does.

486
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,591
We've seen a lot of stuff today.

487
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,228
Maybe we should start
thinking about going home.

488
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,368
Who gets dropped first?

489
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,533
Gee, I don't know.

490
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,372
I live downtown.

491
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,868
We both live downtown.

492
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,883
It depends on what way
you want to go.

493
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:36,718
If we took Fifth, then we'd
get to your house first.

494
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,052
We could do that.

495
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,888
But Fifth is so jammed,
isn't it?

496
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,393
Sometimes...

497
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,895
You live in Chelsea, don't you?

498
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,731
I guess if you live in Chelsea,
that's probably first.

499
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,065
And then April.

500
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,297
Great.

501
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,344
Naturally,
I get taken home first.

502
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,348
Obviously, he prefers April.

503
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,840
Of course, I was
so tongue... tied all night.

504
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,854
I can't believe I said that
about the Guggenheim.

505
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,346
My stupid roller... skating joke.
I should never tell jokes.

506
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,850
Mom can tell 'em, and Hannah,
but I kill 'em.

507
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,363
Where did April
come up with that stuff...

508
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,856
about Adolf Loos
and terms like "organic form"?

509
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,368
Well, naturally.

510
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,371
She went to Brandeis.

511
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,340
I don't think she knows
what she's talking about.

512
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,343
Could you believe the way
she was calling him David?

513
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,346
"Yes, David. I feel
that way, too, David.

514
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,972
"What a marvelous space, David."

515
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,482
I hate April.

516
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,882
She's pushy.

517
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,853
Now they'll dump me,
and she'll invite him up.

518
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:47,348
I blew it,
and I really like him a lot.

519
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,850
Screw it.
I'm not going to get upset.

520
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,864
I've got reading to do tonight.

521
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,867
I'll go to bed early,
turn on a movie...

522
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,391
and take an extra Seconal.

523
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,446
Oh, my goodness.

524
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,920
What are you doing here?

525
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,422
I'm looking for a bookstore.

526
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,924
In this section of town?

527
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,425
I'm killing time.

528
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,429
I have a client near here,
and I'm early.

529
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,931
How about you?

530
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,432
You live near here.

531
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,934
I do.

532
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,435
Where are you headed?

533
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,937
To my A.A. Meeting.

534
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,930
Why do you still go to those?
You never touch alcohol.

535
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,943
You didn't know me
before Frederick.

536
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,445
I'd start with a beer at 10 a.m.

537
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,448
You must have been very unhappy.

538
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,949
Unhappy and fat.

539
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,952
I still find the meetings
very comforting.

540
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,453
I'll never understand it.

541
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,991
You're so bright
and charming and beautiful.

542
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,390
I think to myself...

543
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,394
"What problems
could she possibly have?"

544
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,896
Don't let me get started
on my childhood.

545
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,398
You know what?

546
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,401
There is a bookstore...
a couple blocks from here.

547
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,902
You'd really love it.

548
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,404
You would.

549
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,201
If you have some free time...

550
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,400
Sure.

551
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,635
Thank you.

552
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,473
Isn't this great?
They have everything here.

553
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,673
It's wonderful.

554
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,875
What book did you want to buy?

555
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,510
- What?
- You wanted to buy a book?

556
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,817
I'm killing time.
I just wanted to browse.

557
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,823
You sure picked the right place.

558
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,826
You can stay here
all afternoon and just read.

559
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,159
Unless you had some time.
We could get some coffee.

560
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,664
I don't have time.

561
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,667
I understand completely.

562
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,896
No problem.
You're busy. I...

563
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,268
You seem tense.
Is everything all right?

564
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,442
Everything's OK?

565
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,205
Yeah. How are you?

566
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,212
I'm all right.

567
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,577
How's Frederick?

568
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,016
Fine. We went to the Caravaggio
exhibition at the Met.

569
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:04,010
It's such a treat to go
through a museum with Frederick.

570
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,522
You learn so much.

571
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,048
Do you like Caravaggio?

572
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,458
Who doesn't?

573
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,688
Look.

574
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,533
E.E. Cummings.
I'd like to get you this.

575
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,001
I can't let you get me that.

576
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:21,062
- I'd like to very much.
- I don't think so.

577
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,303
I read a poem of you
and thought of his last week...

578
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,142
A poem of his
and thought of you.

579
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,669
You'll be fine.

580
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,512
This is great.
I love E.E. Cummings.

581
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,018
I'd love to get you this...

582
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,079
and maybe we could
discuss it sometime.

583
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,651
Thanks a lot.

584
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,164
Thanks for showing me
the bookstore.

585
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,167
Perhaps you could take me
to an A.A. Meeting sometime.

586
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,135
I'd love to see what goes on.

587
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,637
You'd love it.

588
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,800
It's really entertaining.
You'd have a good time.

589
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,810
And don't forget
the poem on page 112.

590
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,778
It reminded me of you.

591
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,246
Really?

592
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,910
Page 112.

593
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:22,890
"Your slightest look
easily will unclose me.

594
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,664
"Though I've closed myself,
as fingers...

595
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,730
"you open always,
petal by petal, myself...

596
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,365
"as spring opens...

597
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,842
"touching skillfully,
mysteriously...

598
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,401
"her first rose."

599
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,372
"I do not know
what it is about you...

600
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,884
"that closes and opens...

601
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,752
"only something in me
understands.

602
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:48,816
"The voice of your eyes
is deeper than all roses.

603
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,523
"Nobody, not even the rain...

604
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,590
"has such small hands."

605
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,056
I wasn't too happy
with the results...

606
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,558
of your E.N.G.
Or your B.S.E.R. Either...

607
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,618
which is why I sent you
to tomography...

608
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,654
which was all that stuff
rolling around.

609
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,632
See this gray area here?

610
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:07,161
That gray area's what I had
hoped we wouldn't run into.

611
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:11,266
I'd like you to come in Monday
for a CAT scan.

612
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,903
A brain scan?

613
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,914
Let's take one step at a time.

614
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,813
We won't make any decisions...

615
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,341
until we have
all the information, all right?

616
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,657
Take it easy.

617
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,159
He didn't say you had anything.

618
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:34,154
He just doesn't like the spot
on your x... ray, that's all.

619
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,657
Doesn't mean you have anything.
Don't jump to conclusions.

620
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,192
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

621
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,262
You're in the middle
of New York City.

622
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,796
This is your town.

623
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,935
You're surrounded by people
and traffic and restaurants.

624
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:51,040
God, how can you just,
one day, vanish?

625
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:54,677
Keep calm.
You're going to be OK.

626
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,619
Don't panic.

627
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:00,385
I'm dying! I know it!

628
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,393
There's a spot on my lungs!

629
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,826
Take it easy, will you?

630
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,592
It's not on your lungs.
It's on your ear.

631
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,031
The same thing, isn't it?

632
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,864
I can't sleep.

633
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:15,066
God, there's a tumor in my head
the size of a basketball.

634
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:19,065
Now I keep thinking I can
feel it every time I blink.

635
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,578
He wants me to do
a brain scan...

636
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,581
to confirm
what he already suspects.

637
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:27,574
I'll make a deal with God.
Let it just be my ear.

638
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,087
I'll go deaf,
and blind in one eye, maybe...

639
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,112
but I don't want
a brain operation.

640
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,623
Once they go into my skull...

641
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,592
I'll wind up like the guy
with the wool cap...

642
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,857
who delivers for the florist.

643
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,729
Relax. Your whole life
you run to doctors.

644
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,097
The news is always fine.

645
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,830
That's not true.
What about years ago?

646
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,397
I'm sorry to say
that you cannot have children.

647
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,510
Is there no chance?

648
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,879
This doesn't mean that you
can't have a normal sex life...

649
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,909
but Mr. Saxe's tests indicate
that he is infertile...

650
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,751
small sperm volume
and infertile.

651
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,223
Isn't there anything I can do?
Push... ups or hormones?

652
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,418
I'm afraid not.

653
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,427
I got to get a second opinion.

654
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,860
This is the second opinion.

655
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,557
Then a third opinion.

656
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,327
I realize this is a blow.

657
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,994
My experience is that
many very fine marriages...

658
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:21,005
become unstable
and are destroyed...

659
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,236
by an inability to deal
with this sort of problem.

660
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,005
I hope you won't make
too much of it.

661
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,478
One can adopt children...

662
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:31,971
and there are various artificial
methods of fertilization.

663
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,984
I'm so humiliated. I don't...

664
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,043
Could you have
ruined yourself somehow?

665
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,520
How could I ruin myself?

666
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,149
I don't know.
Excessive masturbation?

667
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,024
You going to start
knocking my hobbies? Jesus.

668
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,029
Maybe we can adopt a child.

669
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,031
What about
artificial insemination?

670
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,532
What are you talking about?

671
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,000
I would get implanted
from a donor.

672
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,263
A stranger?

673
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,828
They have these banks
where they keep them frozen.

674
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,396
You want a defrosted kid?

675
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,432
I want to experience childbirth.

676
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,602
With a stranger?

677
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,340
Just think about it.
That's all I ask.

678
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,611
I think that's the best show
you two ever wrote.

679
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,118
The funniest show
Mickey and I ever did...

680
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,643
was the one we won the Emmy for.

681
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,213
I think as far as laughs...

682
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,725
that was probably
the best thing we ever did.

683
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,227
It was very funny...

684
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,320
but the show about
the two Frenchmen...

685
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,854
that was funny and warm.

686
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,264
We got that idea
on that Paris trip.

687
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,768
Do you remember that trip?

688
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,236
You had jet lag
for six straight weeks.

689
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,934
But I guess we had fun
when we were there.

690
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,341
Sorry. Coffee?

691
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,811
Listen, you guys, we...

692
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,313
Want some more?

693
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,078
We had something we really
wanted to discuss with you.

694
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,917
Jesus, this is very delicate...

695
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:47,049
and I'd only bring this up
amongst friends.

696
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,059
I mean, this is...

697
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,551
this should not go
any further than this room.

698
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,087
I'm all ears.

699
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,470
Hannah and I
can't have any children.

700
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,406
I don't want to get
into whose fault it is...

701
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,908
it's my fault...

702
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:07,376
and the details are
too embarrassing to...

703
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,381
We decided after
a lot of discussion...

704
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,179
that we'd try
with artificial insemination.

705
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,913
I'm not so sure
I like that idea myself.

706
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,480
I didn't really want
to go to a sperm bank...

707
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,991
have some anonymous donor.

708
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,493
I just... I wouldn't want that.

709
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,996
We felt if we were
going to do it...

710
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,498
we'd like somebody
we knew and liked...

711
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,194
and was warm and bright.

712
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,532
Feel free to say no.

713
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,539
We realize it has
all kinds of implications.

714
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,566
The point that we're making
is that we need some sperm.

715
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,080
Well...

716
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:49,086
my first reaction
after the initial shock...

717
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,111
is flattered that you'd ask me.

718
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,622
I'd be the father.

719
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,091
You'd just have to masturbate
into a little cup.

720
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,559
I can handle that.

721
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,062
Obviously,
we wouldn't have intercourse.

722
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:03,033
Gosh. Listen, I've got
to tell you the truth here.

723
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,900
- I'm a little uneasy about this.
- I know it's a lot to ask.

724
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,896
I feel for you. I do.
I'm going to cry.

725
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,035
You want my husband
to have a child with you?

726
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,544
Don't answer now.

727
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,312
Just take it home
and think about it for a while.

728
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,946
I gave blood before
and, uh, clothing to the poor.

729
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,957
I want to talk
about this at home.

730
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:30,757
I think it's a matter
for your analyst and mine.

731
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,558
And maybe my lawyer.

732
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:37,557
We understand completely
if you feel you'd rather not.

733
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,571
I didn't mean
to spoil the evening.

734
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:44,097
Now let's move on
to another topic.

735
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,111
So you had
my ex... partner's baby.

736
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,339
Twins.

737
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,472
And maybe that did
cause some trouble...

738
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,847
but I think we were
drifting apart anyhow.

739
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:56,183
Now, instead of man and wife,
we're just good friends.

740
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,781
Boy, love is really
unpredictable.

741
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,703
Say hello to Dusty Fry.

742
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,839
Hi, Dusty.

743
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,373
Dusty's just bought
a huge house in Southampton...

744
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,885
and he's decorating it.

745
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,386
It's a weird place, actually.

746
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,185
A lot of wall space.
How you doing, man?

747
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,159
I told him about your work,
and he's very excited.

748
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:13,152
I got an Andy Warhol
and a Frank Stella, too.

749
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,665
It's very beautiful...
big, weird.

750
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,168
If you stare
at that Stella too long...

751
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,397
the colors just seem to float.

752
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,963
Have you decided
about becoming a collector?

753
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,975
I got a lot to learn, though.

754
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,534
I wasn't into art
when I was a kid.

755
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,206
Do you appreciate drawings?

756
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,075
She's beautiful.

757
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:41,116
But, really, I need something...
I'm looking for something big.

758
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,716
Show him the oils.

759
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,193
They're in the basement.

760
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,197
Frederick's done this new series
you would really love.

761
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,698
Are they big?

762
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,200
Some of them, yeah.

763
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,794
'Cause I got a lot
of wall space.

764
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't sell my work
by the yard.

765
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,174
How's everything?

766
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,116
Oh, you know.
I talked to Hannah.

767
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:10,052
She said you two
might be going...

768
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,554
to the country
for the weekend.

769
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,183
She loves to go in the woods.

770
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,692
But I'd go nuts.

771
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,193
It's a conflict.

772
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,197
I have to get
my teeth cleaned this week.

773
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,722
That's nice.

774
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,638
I figured I'd get Frederick
and Dusty together.

775
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,139
That's really nice.

776
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:32,142
This kid, he's earned
a trillion dollars.

777
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,269
He's got, like,
six gold records.

778
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,779
Speaking of records...

779
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,281
I bought that Mozart
trio you recommended...

780
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,784
and the man
in the record shop...

781
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,286
showed me another one
I think you'd love.

782
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,754
It's another Bach.
Second movement.

783
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,280
You have that one?

784
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,883
I'd love to hear it.

785
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:53,454
Holly met a wonderful man
who loves opera... an architect.

786
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,964
That's nice.

787
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,661
I'd love to see her
wind up settled.

788
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,136
She's a tense one.

789
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,972
Isn't that beautiful?

790
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,778
I know this.

791
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,682
Bach, F... minor Concerto.

792
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,710
It's one of my favorites.

793
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,458
Did you ever get around
to E.E. Cummings?

794
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,192
He's just adorable.

795
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,201
They have a very large
gay clientele...

796
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,203
where I get my teeth cleaned...

797
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,705
and all the hygienists
now wear gloves...

798
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,537
because they're afraid of AIDS.

799
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,769
Right.

800
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:46,978
Did you ever get around
to the poem on page 112?

801
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:51,511
It made me cry, it was
so beautiful, so romantic.

802
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,959
I want so badly to kiss her.

803
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,460
Not here, you idiot.

804
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,486
You've got to get her
alone someplace...

805
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,964
but I've got to proceed
cautiously.

806
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,467
This is a very delicate
situation.

807
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:10,440
Ask her if you can see her
for lunch or a drink tomorrow...

808
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:14,535
and be ready to make light of
the offer if she's unresponsive.

809
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,911
This has to be done very
skillfully and diplomatically.

810
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,075
Did you ever read this one?

811
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,678
- Don't!
- I'm in love with you.

812
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,517
What are you doing?

813
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,050
I'm sorry.
I have to talk to you.

814
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,757
I've been in love
with you for so long.

815
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,563
I don't have an interest
in selling it.

816
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,036
I ask for something
with puce in it...

817
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,505
you fly off the handle.

818
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,066
I'm not interested in what
your interior decorator thinks.

819
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,544
I can't commit to anything
without consulting her first.

820
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,547
That's what I have her for.

821
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,049
This is degrading.
You don't buy paintings...

822
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,846
to blend in with the sofa.

823
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,854
It's not a sofa.
It's an ottoman.

824
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:02,052
God, forget it.
Let's just get out of here.

825
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:05,721
What a weirdo that guy is.
Paranoid.

826
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,828
What's the matter with you?

827
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,026
I'll be OK.

828
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,535
It's no big deal.
We didn't hit it off.

829
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,037
You go on ahead.

830
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,868
Are you OK? You're sweating.

831
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,807
I just need some fresh air.
Something I ate.

832
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,310
I'll walk. You go ahead.

833
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,936
You go.

834
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,104
There you are.
I was looking for you.

835
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,376
I must apologize.
I'm so mixed up.

836
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:01,282
How do you expect me
to react to such a thing?

837
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,548
I know,
but I'm in love with you.

838
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,077
Don't say those words.

839
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,589
I'm sorry.
I know it's terrible.

840
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,091
You know the situation.

841
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,592
I know. I realize.

842
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,754
What do you expect me to say?

843
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,263
Hannah and I
are in the last stages.

844
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:17,267
She's never said anything,
and we're very close.

845
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:21,465
She's crazy about me,
but somewhere along the line...

846
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,200
I've fallen
out of love with her.

847
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,037
Not because of me?

848
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,940
I love you.

849
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,605
I can't be the cause of anything
between you and Hannah.

850
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,581
It was inevitable
that Hannah and I part.

851
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,775
Why?

852
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,078
For a million reasons.

853
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,585
But not over me?

854
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,281
We were both going
in different directions.

855
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,482
Poor Hannah.

856
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,787
Do you share
any of my feelings...

857
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,986
or is this
an unpleasant embarrassment?

858
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,495
I can't say anything.

859
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,498
Please be candid.
I don't want you to feel bad.

860
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:51,524
I have certain feelings
for you...

861
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,696
but don't make me
say anything more.

862
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:57,468
You've said enough.
I'll work things out.

863
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,169
Don't do anything on my behalf.

864
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,575
I live with Frederick,
and Hannah and I are close.

865
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,580
But you care about me?

866
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,583
I can't be a party to this.

867
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,211
I'm racked with guilt
just talking to you.

868
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,586
Your guilt is because
you feel the same.

869
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,922
Please, I have to go.
I have to get my teeth cleaned.

870
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,023
I have my answer.

871
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,657
I'm walking on air.

872
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,185
Hi. How's she doing?

873
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,188
I'm glad to see you.
She's in the kitchen.

874
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,190
It's the same thing.

875
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,317
She promises.
It's all lies.

876
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,294
Don't make it worse, Dad.

877
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,296
Hi, Mom. How you doing?

878
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,730
Let me get you some coffee.

879
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,233
What triggered it?

880
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,235
We were making a commercial...

881
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,669
and there was this young,
good... looking salesman...

882
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:04,139
and your mother was
throwing herself at him...

883
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,607
in a disgusting way.

884
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,079
And when she found she
was too old to seduce him...

885
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,081
that he was embarrassed by her...

886
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,275
Liar!

887
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,774
And at lunch she got
drunker and drunker.

888
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,344
Finally, she became
Joan Collins!

889
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,857
All my life, I've had
to put up with insults...

890
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,358
from this nonperson...

891
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,851
this haircut
that passes for a man.

892
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,864
He could never support us.

893
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:31,334
It's a good thing
we had a talented daughter.

894
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,836
I can only hope
that she was mine.

895
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,736
With you as her mother...

896
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,207
her father could be anybody
in Actor's Equity!

897
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,904
She's talented,
so it's unlikely she's yours.

898
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:45,108
Could you stay in the other room
and let me take care of her?

899
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:48,585
You never know when she's
going to fall off the wagon...

900
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,813
and humiliate everybody.

901
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,549
Here, Mom. Drink this.

902
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,056
You're awful.

903
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,786
You probably were flirting.

904
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:58,795
I like to joke around
and have fun...

905
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,730
and he gets angry
because I get the attention.

906
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:04,233
He's gotten sour
as he's gotten older...

907
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:07,203
and I've tried
to stay young at heart.

908
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,671
You promised
to stay on the wagon.

909
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,403
The sacrifices I've made
because of that man.

910
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,003
He's ruined me with his ego,
his philandering...

911
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,377
his mediocrity.

912
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,609
Stop being so dramatic.

913
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,642
He's the one that's laid
every ingnue in stock!

914
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,512
They wanted me
for a screen test...

915
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,821
but I knew that
he'd get up there...

916
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:32,260
and he'd flounder around
with his expensive haircuts...

917
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,491
hairdos, and clothes.

918
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,998
He's all show.

919
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,001
Now, how can you act...

920
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,027
when there's nothing
inside to come out?

921
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,018
She was so beautiful
at one time...

922
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,020
and he was so dashing...

923
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,990
both of them
just full of promise...

924
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,288
and hopes that
never materialized.

925
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,089
And the fights...

926
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:08,030
and the constant infidelities
to prove themselves...

927
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,623
and blaming each other.

928
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,133
It's so sad.

929
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,830
They loved the idea
of having us kids...

930
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,840
but raising us
didn't interest them much...

931
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,843
but it's impossible
to hold it against them.

932
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,868
They didn't know anything else.

933
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,642
Of all of us in the family...

934
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,650
you were the one blessed
with the true gift.

935
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:30,551
My true gift is luck.

936
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,521
From my first show, you know?

937
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:36,492
I always thought Lee was the one
destined for great things.

938
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,985
She's lovely, but she
doesn't have your spark.

939
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,498
She knows it.
She worships you.

940
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,195
She wouldn't dare
get up there on stage.

941
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,567
Now, Holly's not shy.

942
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,595
Holly's game for anything.

943
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,902
Holly takes after me.

944
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,101
True.

945
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,771
I'd have been
a great dope addict.

946
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,303
You remember this, Hannah?

947
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,728
Mr. Saxe, I'm afraid
the news is not good.

948
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:30,004
If I can show you
exactly where the tumor is...

949
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,942
and why we feel that surgery
would be of no use.

950
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,604
See...

951
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,840
It's over.

952
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:41,881
I'm face to face with eternity.

953
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,945
Not later, but now.

954
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:49,755
I'm so frightened, I can't move
or speak or breathe.

955
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,529
You're just fine.

956
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:56,031
There's absolutely
nothing here at all...

957
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,557
and your tests are all fine.

958
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,969
I must admit, I was concerned,
given your symptoms.

959
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,735
What caused this hearing loss
in one ear...

960
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,243
I guess we'll never
really know for sure...

961
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,246
but whatever it was, it's
certainly not anything serious.

962
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,872
I'm very relieved.

963
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:31,532
What do you mean,
you're quitting?

964
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,036
Why? The news is good.

965
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,470
You don't have cancer...

966
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:36,733
the thing.

967
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:40,106
Do you realize what a thread
we're all hanging by?

968
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,976
You're off the hook.
You should be celebrating.

969
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,982
Can you understand
how meaningless everything is?

970
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,483
Everything,
I'm talking about...

971
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,985
our lives, the show,
the whole world.

972
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,851
But you're not dying.

973
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,856
I'm not dying now...

974
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,358
but when I ran
out of the hospital...

975
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,860
I was so thrilled...

976
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,862
and I'm running
down the street...

977
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,363
and, suddenly, I stop.

978
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:04,799
It hit me...
so I'm not going to go today...

979
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,804
but, eventually, I'm going
to be in that position.

980
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,965
You're just realizing this now?

981
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,975
I don't realize it now.

982
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,968
I know it all the time,
but I manage to stick it...

983
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,981
in the back of my mind.

984
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,915
Can I tell you something?

985
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,110
Yes, please.

986
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,619
A week ago, I bought a rifle.

987
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,917
I was going to kill myself.

988
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,390
The only thing that
might have stopped me...

989
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,825
is my parents
would be devastated.

990
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,227
I would have to
shoot them also, first...

991
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,628
and then my aunt and uncle.

992
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,598
It would have been a bloodbath.

993
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:40,763
Well, eventually, it is
going to happen to all of us.

994
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,238
Yes, but doesn't that ruin
everything for you?

995
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,741
It just takes the pleasure
out of everything.

996
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,744
You're going to die,
I'm going to die...

997
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,246
the audience, the network,
the sponsor, everybody.

998
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,181
I know, and your hamster.

999
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,684
Listen, kid,
I think you snapped your cap.

1000
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,177
Maybe you need a few weeks
in Bermuda or something...

1001
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,621
or go to a whorehouse.

1002
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:04,559
I can't stay on the show.
I got to get some answers.

1003
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:07,154
Otherwise, I'm going
to do something drastic.

1004
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,517
I thought you weren't coming.

1005
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:30,019
I almost didn't.

1006
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,078
I didn't sleep all night.

1007
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,090
No, I'm sure.

1008
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,786
What are we doing
meeting in a hotel room?

1009
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,260
It's terrible, isn't it?

1010
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:41,264
I couldn't think where to
invite you without taking risks.

1011
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,766
I promised myself
I wouldn't let this happen...

1012
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,267
till you were living alone.

1013
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,793
I was so torn when you called.

1014
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,806
I wanted to call you
every day...

1015
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,308
since I first
told you how I felt.

1016
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:54,333
I resisted so many times.

1017
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,804
Don't think badly of me.

1018
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,752
This is not an easy situation.

1019
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,277
I know it isn't.

1020
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,936
That was just perfect.

1021
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,467
You've ruined me
for anyone else.

1022
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:32,004
I don't want anyone else
ever to have you.

1023
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,347
I was so worried
I wouldn't compare with Hannah.

1024
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,852
Oh, my God.

1025
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,549
You really do have
those thoughts, don't you?

1026
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,614
All the time.

1027
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,252
I know she must be
a really passionate person.

1028
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,785
Yes, she's very warm
and giving...

1029
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,129
but it's me that wants
to be giving to you.

1030
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,465
I want to do things for you.

1031
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,800
Hannah doesn't need me as much.

1032
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,765
I'm being presumptuous.

1033
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,604
Not that you need me.

1034
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:03,135
I want you to take care of me...

1035
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,581
and I love
when you do things to me.

1036
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,573
You're late.

1037
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,240
Lucy and I kept talking.

1038
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:41,478
I didn't realize
how late it had gotten.

1039
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:45,477
You missed a very dull TV show
about Auschwitz.

1040
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,581
More gruesome film clips...

1041
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:51,856
and more puzzled intellectuals
declaring their mystification...

1042
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,625
over the systematic murder
of millions.

1043
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,155
The reason why they can never
answer the question...

1044
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,966
"How could it possibly happen?"
Is that it's the wrong question.

1045
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,529
Given what people are,
the question is...

1046
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,040
"Why doesn't it
happen more often?"

1047
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,940
Of course, it does,
in subtler forms.

1048
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:10,003
I have a little headache
from this weather.

1049
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,216
It's been ages since I sat
in front of the TV...

1050
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,052
just changing channels
to find something.

1051
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,320
You see the whole culture...

1052
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,690
Nazis...

1053
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,490
deodorant salesman...

1054
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,155
wrestlers...

1055
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,563
beauty contests,
the talk show.

1056
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,535
Can you imagine the level of
a mind that watches wrestling?

1057
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,131
But the worst are
the Fundamentalist preachers...

1058
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:38,435
third... rate con men...

1059
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,705
telling the poor suckers
that watch them...

1060
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:42,644
that they speak for Jesus...

1061
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,115
and to please send in money.
Money, money, money.

1062
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:50,279
If Jesus came back and saw
what's going on in his name...

1063
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,117
he'd never stop throwing up.

1064
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,919
Oh, God, Frederick,
could you please lighten up?

1065
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,482
I'm not in the mood...

1066
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:59,757
to hear a review
of contemporary society again.

1067
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,629
You've been very nervous lately.

1068
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,497
I can't take this anymore.

1069
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,502
I'm trying to complete
an education...

1070
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:07,969
I started on you five years ago.

1071
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,495
I'm not your pupil.
I was, but I'm not.

1072
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:14,135
When you leave the nest,
I want you to be ready.

1073
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,270
We have to make some changes.

1074
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,405
Like what?

1075
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,381
You know what.
I'm suffocating.

1076
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,543
Are we going to have
this conversation again?

1077
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,848
Yes, we're going to have
this conversation again.

1078
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,515
I have to leave.
I have to move out.

1079
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,024
- Why?
- Because I have to.

1080
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,152
What are you going
to use for money?

1081
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,789
I thought maybe I'd move in
with my parents for a while.

1082
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,698
I always told you
you would leave me.

1083
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,668
Does it have to be now?

1084
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:43,332
Maybe it will only be temporary,
but I have to try.

1085
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,700
You're my whole world.

1086
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,346
Good God.
Have you been kissed tonight?

1087
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,952
Yes, you have.
You've been with someone!

1088
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,851
Stop accusing me!

1089
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:01,379
I'm too smart, Lee.
You can't fool me!

1090
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,449
- You're turning red!
- Leave me alone!

1091
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,984
Oh, Christ!
What's wrong with you?

1092
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,793
I'm sorry.

1093
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,596
Why couldn't you say something?

1094
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,829
You have to slither around
behind my back.

1095
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,337
I'm saying it now!

1096
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,068
So you met somebody else?

1097
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:22,244
You knew it was going to happen
sooner or later.

1098
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,711
I can't live like this.

1099
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,214
Who is it?

1100
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:26,738
Just somebody I met.

1101
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,648
Who? Where did you meet him?

1102
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,552
It doesn't matter.
I have to move out.

1103
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,148
You're my only connection
to the world.

1104
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,158
That's too much responsibility
for me.

1105
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:40,458
It's not fair.
I want a less complicated life.

1106
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:43,295
I want a husband, maybe a child,
before it's too late.

1107
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,563
Jesus. Jesus.

1108
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:48,867
Oh, God.
I don't even know what I want.

1109
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,567
What do you get out of me,
anyway? I mean...

1110
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:59,343
It's not sexual anymore.

1111
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:00,906
It's certainly not intellectual.

1112
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,578
You're so superior to me
in every way.

1113
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,281
Don't patronize me!

1114
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:12,453
God! I should have married you
years ago when you wanted to.

1115
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,860
I should have agreed.

1116
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:18,163
Don't you know
it never would have worked?

1117
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,328
I told you one day
you would leave me...

1118
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,167
for a younger man. I...

1119
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,881
What passion today with Lee.

1120
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,910
She's a volcano.

1121
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,718
It was a totally
fulfilling experience...

1122
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,918
just as I'd dreamed it would be.

1123
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,426
That's what it was.

1124
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,919
It was like living out a dream,
a great dream.

1125
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:52,424
Now I feel very good and cozy
being here next to Hannah.

1126
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,233
There's something very lovely
and real about Hannah.

1127
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:59,765
She gives me a very deep feeling
of being part of something.

1128
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:04,007
She's a wonderful woman,
and I betrayed her.

1129
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,709
She came into my empty life
and changed it...

1130
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:10,651
and I paid her back by banging
her sister in a hotel room.

1131
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,211
God, I'm despicable.

1132
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,689
What a cruel
and shallow thing to do.

1133
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:17,488
I have to call her and tell her
what we did was crazy.

1134
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,995
It can't ever happen again.
I'm not that kind of man.

1135
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,758
I value Hannah too much.

1136
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,460
I love my wife.
Now I betrayed her.

1137
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,763
Oh, God.

1138
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,201
Where are you going?

1139
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:31,697
I've got to get a phone number.
I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

1140
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,208
- Lt's so late.
- I know.

1141
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,710
I can't believe I forgot.

1142
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,076
What if he answers?

1143
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,580
I'll hang up.

1144
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,242
I'll tell her
we can't communicate...

1145
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,080
until I terminate my marriage...

1146
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:43,085
it's immoral.

1147
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,586
Then time will pass...

1148
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,249
I won't call,
and she'll get the idea.

1149
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,748
I've got to stop this
before I get in too deep.

1150
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:54,092
I'd rather hurt Lee a little
than destroy Hannah.

1151
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,654
It's 1:30.

1152
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:59,657
She can't have a conversation
with me with him around.

1153
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,636
I'm getting hysterical.

1154
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,231
I'll call her first thing
in the morning.

1155
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,003
I'll call her at 6:00.

1156
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,602
Frederick goes jogging at 6:00.

1157
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:11,273
She'll be alone.
I'll call her.

1158
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,476
I've got it! I've got it!
I've got it!

1159
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,582
Mel!

1160
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,555
I would have hung up
if you hadn't answered.

1161
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:24,287
I won't do this again,
but I had to tell you...

1162
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:28,525
I feel very close to you
tonight, very, very close.

1163
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,759
Good night.

1164
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:47,940
Millions of books written
on every conceivable subject...

1165
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,781
by all these great minds...

1166
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,788
and in the end, none of them
knows anything more...

1167
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:55,916
about the big questions
of life than I do.

1168
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,950
I read Socrates.

1169
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:01,191
This guy used to knock off
little Greek boys.

1170
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,960
What the hell's
he got to teach me?

1171
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,333
And Nietzsche, with his theory
of eternal recurrence.

1172
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,463
He said that
the life we live...

1173
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,700
we're going to live
over and over again...

1174
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,800
the exact same way
for eternity.

1175
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,334
Great. That means I'll have
to sit through...

1176
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,006
the Ice Capades again.

1177
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,810
It's not worth it.

1178
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,443
And Freud,
another great pessimist.

1179
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:26,012
I was in analysis for years.
Nothing happened.

1180
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,455
My poor analyst
got so frustrated...

1181
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,460
the guy finally put in
a salad bar.

1182
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,462
Look at all these
people jogging...

1183
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:34,895
trying to stave off...

1184
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:37,456
the inevitable decay
of the body.

1185
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,128
Boy, it's so sad
what people go through...

1186
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:43,434
with their stationary bike
and their exercise and their...

1187
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,338
Oh, look at this one.

1188
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,672
Poor thing.

1189
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:50,167
My God, she has to tote
all that fat around.

1190
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,681
She should pull it on a dolly.

1191
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:56,173
Maybe the poets are right.
Maybe love is the only answer.

1192
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,677
I was in love with Hannah.
That didn't work out.

1193
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,190
I even took her sister out.
Remember that?

1194
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:05,194
Remember years ago when
Hannah and I got divorced...

1195
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:08,026
and she fixed me up
with her sister Holly?

1196
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,395
I want to be like you

1197
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:15,097
I'm gonna fit to your groove

1198
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,066
I don't want to be different

1199
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:21,941
So I'm gonna be just like you

1200
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,605
'Cause I go buy records

1201
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:26,080
That they play on the radio

1202
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,241
I'm gonna dance that club

1203
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:32,743
Gonna do just what I'm told

1204
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:36,020
I'm pleadin'...

1205
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,527
Why are you making those faces?

1206
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:41,052
I can't hear you.
I can't hear anything.

1207
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,565
I'm going to lose hearing
in my ear.

1208
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,066
Listen,
you're witnessing genius.

1209
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,626
My ears are experiencing
a meltdown.

1210
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,137
I can't hear anything.

1211
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:52,141
Can't you feel the energy?
A tangible energy.

1212
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,234
The room's alive
with positive vibrations.

1213
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,744
Holly, I'm frightened.

1214
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,246
After their set,
they're going to take hostages.

1215
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,079
Let's... Don't... No, please.
You... No.

1216
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:03,085
You want some? Come on, Mickey.

1217
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,087
You've been doing that
all night.

1218
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:08,113
You're going to develop
a third nostril.

1219
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,454
Don't. Please.

1220
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,050
Can we go?

1221
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,296
'Cause I go buy records

1222
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:17,026
That they play on the radio

1223
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,899
I love songs about
extraterrestrial life...

1224
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,062
don't you?

1225
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,299
Not when they're sung
by extraterrestrials.

1226
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:24,806
I cannot communicate with you.

1227
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,742
I never realized
you were such a tight... ass.

1228
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:30,245
Your sisters have such
good taste in music.

1229
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,247
I don't know where
you went wrong.

1230
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,578
I'm my own person.

1231
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:36,107
Can I take you to hear
something nice?

1232
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,619
Mickey, it's getting late.

1233
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,120
Because you're being angry.

1234
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:42,124
I'm not angry, but you
don't believe in E.S. P...

1235
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,126
you don't like rock music,
you won't get high.

1236
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,128
It's like I'm dating
Cardinal Cook.

1237
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:54,966
Why am I

1238
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:58,462
Just as reckless as a child?

1239
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:01,238
Why am I

1240
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,838
Like a racehorse runnin' wild?

1241
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,577
Why am I

1242
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:11,519
In a state of ecstasy?

1243
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:15,991
The reason is 'cause
something's happened to me

1244
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:19,324
I'm in love again

1245
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:22,559
And the spring is comin'

1246
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,259
I'm in love again

1247
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,335
Hear my heartstrings strummin'

1248
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,931
I'm in love again

1249
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:34,238
And the hymn they're hummin'

1250
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,643
Is those cuddle... up

1251
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,648
Huddle... up blues

1252
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:42,810
I'm in love again

1253
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:46,379
And I can't rise above it

1254
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,686
I'm in love again

1255
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:52,216
And I love, love, love it

1256
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,058
Thanks for a swell time.

1257
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:57,554
You didn't have to talk
while the guy was singing.

1258
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,999
I was so bored.

1259
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,593
You don't deserve Cole Porter.

1260
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,001
You should stay
with those groups...

1261
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,302
that look like they're going
to stab their mothers.

1262
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,705
I'm open to new concepts.

1263
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,335
You don't have to snort cocaine
all the time.

1264
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,572
Do you carry a kilo
in your purse?

1265
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,911
This crowd wouldn't know the
difference. They're embalmed.

1266
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,315
I'm glad Hannah got us together.

1267
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,184
She's got a great instinct
for people, really.

1268
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,621
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
It's probably my fault.

1269
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,624
I've been a little depressed
lately.

1270
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,125
I had a great time.

1271
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,128
It was like
the Nuremberg Trials.

1272
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:27,595
I'll see myself home!

1273
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,567
Yep, it was quite an evening.

1274
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,433
Holly with her cocaine.

1275
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:38,770
She should've been wearing
a gold shovel around her neck.

1276
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:42,608
She was polymorphously
insensitive, I think.

1277
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,112
Too bad, too...

1278
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:48,640
'cause, you know, I always
had a little crush on her.

1279
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,219
You have to read
the instructions.

1280
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,244
You set one of these things...

1281
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,189
and you can take
pictures underwater.

1282
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:32,718
When we get to the country,
we'll try it in the lake, OK?

1283
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,768
Are you in a bad mood?

1284
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:47,640
I don't know.
I'm just antsy.

1285
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:51,135
I know. The last few weeks,
you haven't been yourself.

1286
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,172
Tonight at dinner,
you were curt with me.

1287
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,548
- Was I?
- Yes, you were.

1288
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:59,645
When I brought up the idea
of having a baby...

1289
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:01,179
you jumped down my throat.

1290
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,691
I don't think
it's a very good idea.

1291
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:04,693
Why not?

1292
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:07,218
It's the last thing
we need right now.

1293
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:10,232
Why do you say that?
Is there something wrong?

1294
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,733
I don't know.

1295
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,291
Should I be worried?

1296
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,304
Well, you got four children.

1297
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,465
I want one with you.

1298
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:21,738
I think we should wait
till things settle.

1299
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,177
What does that mean?

1300
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,680
We've been married four years.

1301
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,615
How settled can things get?

1302
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,618
You have some very set plans...

1303
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,984
on how your life
should be structured...

1304
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:35,422
a house, kids, certain school,
a home in Connecticut.

1305
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,018
It's all very preconceived.

1306
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,518
Yeah, but l...
I thought you needed that.

1307
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:44,533
When we met,
you said your life was chaos.

1308
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,536
But there's got to be
some give and take.

1309
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:51,267
Listen, I don't know
what the hell I'm talking about.

1310
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:53,298
Are you angry with me?

1311
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,939
Are you disenchanted
with our marriage?

1312
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,277
I didn't say that.

1313
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,044
Are you in love
with someone else?

1314
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,950
What is this, the Gestapo? No.

1315
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:06,454
Well, what?
What are you not telling me?

1316
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:07,786
What kind of interrogation...

1317
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:10,451
Supposing I said yes,
I am disenchanted.

1318
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,927
- I am in love with someone else.
- Are you?

1319
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,298
But you keep asking
these awful questions.

1320
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,995
It's like you want me
to say yes.

1321
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,663
What are you talking about?

1322
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,831
Of course not.
I'd be destroyed.

1323
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,535
For Christ's sake,
stop torturing her.

1324
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:30,033
Tell her you want out
and get it over with.

1325
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,047
You're in love with her sister.

1326
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,049
You didn't do it on purpose.

1327
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,052
Be honest.
It's always the best way.

1328
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,577
Can I help you?

1329
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,590
If you're suffering
over something...

1330
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,592
will you share it with me?

1331
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,420
You know how much I love you.

1332
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:52,066
I ought to have
my head examined.

1333
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,591
I don't deserve you.

1334
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,777
I want to look good...

1335
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,940
but I don't want to feel
like I'm overdressed.

1336
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,346
How about this?

1337
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:10,580
I really like that.
That's a pretty color on you.

1338
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,587
Ever think
you'd be helping me...

1339
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:15,112
find something
to wear to the opera?

1340
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:17,625
It's great.
I can't wait to meet him.

1341
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,627
He's married.

1342
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,129
His wife's in and out
of institutions.

1343
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,323
She's schizophrenic.

1344
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,332
Sometimes she's terrific,
then she just breaks down.

1345
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:25,833
He has this sweet daughter.

1346
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:28,268
When she goes to college
next year...

1347
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,771
he's going to split permanently.

1348
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:31,067
He's paid his dues...

1349
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,575
but she helped put him
through architecture school.

1350
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,077
You found all this out
on one date?

1351
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,081
I think he was dying to open up.
It's so sad.

1352
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,175
What should I wear
to my audition?

1353
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:45,119
I've got a singing audition
for a Broadway musical.

1354
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:46,621
I'll never get it.

1355
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:48,589
- Singing?
- Can you believe it?

1356
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,616
- Really?
- Well, I mean, why not?

1357
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,628
What have I got to lose?

1358
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:58,122
No, I just...
No, I didn't know you sang.

1359
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,136
Why, you think everybody
in musicals sings so well?

1360
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:04,867
It's just that they sing.

1361
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,966
Well, you know.

1362
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,136
I sing a little.
I mean, you know.

1363
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,740
I know. No, I know.

1364
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,841
I mean, don't say it that way.

1365
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:18,353
My confidence
is not my strong point.

1366
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:19,854
I didn't mean that.

1367
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:23,256
I think I can fake my way
through a song, easily.

1368
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,761
Why?
You don't think it's realistic?

1369
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,627
No, I didn't... No.

1370
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:33,624
I just hate to see you
put yourself in a position...

1371
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,136
where you get hurt.

1372
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,140
You know how you take
every single rejection...

1373
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,666
as confirmation
that you have no talent.

1374
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,177
Well, maybe I'll get it.

1375
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:44,611
I hope.

1376
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,844
Boy, you really know
how to cut me down.

1377
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:49,851
What? Don't be so sensitive.

1378
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,352
Can't I say anything?

1379
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:54,845
I sing. For Christ's sake,
you heard me sing!

1380
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,188
OK l... What happened?

1381
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,694
We were having
a really nice time...

1382
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,697
and suddenly everything
went to bad feeling.

1383
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:05,757
Nobody but you can do that
to me. I don't know why.

1384
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:08,463
Look,
everything's going your way.

1385
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,569
You're right.

1386
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,074
I'm happy.

1387
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:18,770
Why must I let my insecurities
spoil everything?

1388
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:22,648
Yes, his fancies

1389
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:26,451
Are passing fancies

1390
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:30,515
But sighing sighs,
holding hands

1391
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:35,553
This my heart understands

1392
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:39,056
I'm old... fashioned

1393
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:42,901
And I don't mind it

1394
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:47,068
It's how I want to be

1395
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:52,046
As long as you agree

1396
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:57,781
To stay old... fashioned

1397
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,813
With me

1398
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,347
Thank you very much.

1399
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,292
- Thank you.
- Terrific.

1400
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,560
April Knox.

1401
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:18,269
Someday

1402
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:21,435
When I'm awfully low

1403
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,969
When the world is cold

1404
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,039
I will get a glow

1405
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:31,314
Just thinking of you

1406
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,652
And the way you look

1407
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:38,217
Tonight

1408
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,593
You sounded great.
You may be surprised.

1409
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,325
I'm glad we have a catering job
this week.

1410
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,663
I'm real low on money.

1411
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:49,102
We have Mr. Levine's 80th
birthday on Riverside Drive.

1412
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,266
Or Riverside Memorial Chapel,
depending on his health.

1413
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,776
Listen. David called me up.

1414
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,777
What?

1415
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,779
David called me last night.

1416
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,304
He wants to take me
to the opera.

1417
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:02,317
I didn't know what to say.

1418
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,682
You're joking.

1419
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,210
No, he called late last night.

1420
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:09,924
I'm very surprised.

1421
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,927
He wants to take me
to see "Rigoletto."

1422
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,826
And you're going.

1423
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:16,831
I didn't know what to say.

1424
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:18,799
First I said no,
then he pressed it.

1425
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,392
He said he'd taken you once...

1426
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:22,768
and he really wanted
to invite me.

1427
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:25,673
But I'm seeing him.

1428
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:26,970
I know. I said that...

1429
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,740
but he said it was something
he really felt like doing.

1430
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:37,073
I don't know what to say.

1431
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,110
It's just an evening
at the opera.

1432
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,714
Did I do wrong in accepting?

1433
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,658
Why do you think that you would
like to convert to Catholicism?

1434
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,193
I've got to have something
to believe in...

1435
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,035
otherwise life
is just meaningless.

1436
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:00,541
But why did you make
the decision...

1437
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:03,340
to choose the Catholic faith?

1438
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,542
First of all, because it's
a very beautiful religion...

1439
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,608
and it's a strong religion.
It's very well... structured.

1440
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:11,209
I'm talking now, incidentally...

1441
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:14,222
about the against school prayer,
pro... abortion, antinuclear wing.

1442
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,520
At the moment
you don't believe in God?

1443
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,150
No, and I want to.

1444
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:19,785
I'm willing to do anything.

1445
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,523
I'll dye Easter eggs
if it works.

1446
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,555
I need some evidence.
I got to have proof.

1447
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,366
If I can't believe in God,
then life isn't worth living.

1448
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,872
It means making a very big leap.

1449
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,635
Well, can you help me?

1450
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,377
I don't understand.

1451
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,380
I thought you'd be happy.

1452
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,881
How can we be happy?

1453
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,576
I never thought of God
in my life.

1454
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,380
Now I'm giving it
serious thought.

1455
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,387
Catholicism?
Why not your own people?

1456
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,390
I got off on the wrong foot
with that.

1457
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,824
I need a dramatic change
in my life.

1458
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:52,520
You're going to believe
in Jesus Christ?

1459
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,927
I know it sounds funny,
but I'm going to try.

1460
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,794
But why?
We raised you as a Jew.

1461
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:58,163
Just because I was born
that way...

1462
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,259
I'm old enough
to make a mature decision.

1463
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:01,599
But why Jesus Christ?

1464
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,935
Why, for instance,
shouldn't you become a Buddhist?

1465
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,599
That's totally alien to me.

1466
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,108
You're getting on in years.

1467
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:08,439
Aren't you afraid of dying?

1468
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:09,944
Why should I be afraid?

1469
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,605
- 'Cause you won't exist.
- So?

1470
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,342
That thought
doesn't terrify you?

1471
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:16,215
Who thinks about such nonsense?
When I'm dead, I'll be dead.

1472
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:18,151
I don't understand.
Aren't you frightened?

1473
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,950
Of what? I'll be unconscious.

1474
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,649
But never to exist again?

1475
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,157
How do you know?

1476
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,659
It certainly doesn't
look promising.

1477
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,328
Who knows what will be?

1478
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:28,762
I'll either be unconscious,
or I won't.

1479
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:32,756
If not, I'll deal with it then.
I'm not going to worry now.

1480
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,268
Mom, come out.

1481
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,771
Of course there's a god,
you idiot.

1482
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,272
You don't believe in God?

1483
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:41,765
Then why is there so much evil
in the world?

1484
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,278
On a simplistic level,
why were there Nazis?

1485
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,780
Tell him, Max.

1486
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,782
How the hell do I know?

1487
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,216
I don't know
how the can opener works.

1488
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,597
Hi. Where's Holly?

1489
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:17,605
She's auditioning
for a television commercial.

1490
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,106
She said she'll be late.

1491
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,608
How is she doing?

1492
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:23,304
You know Holly when
she's depressed. She's manic.

1493
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,007
It was a good idea
we invited her to lunch.

1494
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:27,948
I hope you told her
it was your idea.

1495
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:31,248
When I try to help,
she gets defensive.

1496
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,948
She's just embarrassed
in front of you.

1497
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,456
So how are you?

1498
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,457
I'm OK.

1499
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:37,856
Do you miss Frederick?

1500
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,554
I can't believe Elliot and I...

1501
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,723
can't think of someone for you
to go out with.

1502
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:45,324
Are you doing OK?
How's Frederick... Elliot?

1503
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:47,597
He's fine.
I guess he's fine.

1504
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,604
He's been kind of moody lately.

1505
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,106
I don't know
what's wrong with him.

1506
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,074
He's kind of distant, difficult.

1507
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:57,237
I've been trying to talk to him.
He says everything's fine.

1508
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,907
Automatically,
I leap to the worst conclusion...

1509
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,609
he's seeing someone else.

1510
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,777
No, everyone thinks
things like that.

1511
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:06,811
I just came from an audition
which I did not get.

1512
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:08,288
So what's new?

1513
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:10,814
They said I was
too offbeat... looking...

1514
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:12,486
whatever the hell that means.

1515
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,324
But guess who's there
auditioning?

1516
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:15,557
April?

1517
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:17,827
You got it.
I was very polite.

1518
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:20,334
I maintained my poise.
I said hello.

1519
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:21,836
I never trusted April.

1520
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,361
She has eyes
in the back of her head.

1521
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:27,432
She and an architect
are now a very definite item...

1522
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,376
which I still cannot believe.

1523
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:30,639
Although it's put an end...

1524
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:32,374
to the Stanislavski
Catering Company.

1525
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:34,473
Which is why I have
to speak to you.

1526
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:37,917
You'll get impatient, but...
I have to borrow more money.

1527
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:39,045
That's fine.

1528
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:41,555
What I decided to do
is some writing.

1529
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,217
I've had it with acting.

1530
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:45,886
These meaningless auditions
are cattle calls.

1531
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,895
I can't handle
another rejection.

1532
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,396
Let's face it here.

1533
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,889
I've got to latch on
to something in my life...

1534
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:55,960
something with a future.
I'm not sixteen anymore.

1535
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,063
It's just crazy...

1536
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:03,066
but I've got an idea
for a story, more than one...

1537
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:06,945
and I just need a few months
or a year even.

1538
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:10,941
I picked up a lot of dramatic
structure from acting class.

1539
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:16,117
That's good. It just seems to me
that six months or a year...

1540
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,786
if you spend it
more productively...

1541
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:19,953
Like what?

1542
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,462
Well, I don't know.

1543
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:23,964
Didn't Mom mention
there was something...

1544
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,263
at the Museum of Broadcasting?

1545
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,427
That's clerical.

1546
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:31,200
No, didn't she say it was
in the publicity department?

1547
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:33,207
That can lead to other things.

1548
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,731
I knew you'd be discouraging.

1549
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,903
I'm trying to be helpful.

1550
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:38,913
A person doesn't say one day...

1551
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:42,075
"I'm finished as an actress.
Now I'm a writer."

1552
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:45,177
- You mean not at my age.
- Please. We came to have lunch.

1553
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,654
Right. Forget it.

1554
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,657
I just want a salad.

1555
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:51,659
You really think I'm a loser.

1556
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:53,160
You're being ridiculous.

1557
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,662
You are, Holly. Stop it.

1558
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:57,164
- You treat me like a loser.
- How?

1559
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,258
You never have faith
in my plans.

1560
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,563
You always undercut
my enthusiasm.

1561
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:03,002
Not so.
I've been very supportive.

1562
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:05,973
I try to give you honest,
constructive advice.

1563
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,202
I'm always happy
to help you financially.

1564
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,642
I've gone out of my way...

1565
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:12,841
to introduce you
to interesting single men.

1566
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,712
- All losers.
- You're too demanding.

1567
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,308
I could tell
what you thought of me...

1568
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:18,080
by the men
you fixed me up with.

1569
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,451
That's not true.

1570
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:20,785
I know I'm mediocre.

1571
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:22,289
Stop attacking Hannah.

1572
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,019
She's going through
a rough time.

1573
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,549
Why are you so upset?

1574
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,994
You've been picking on her
since she came here.

1575
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:30,793
Leave her alone.
I'm suffocating.

1576
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:33,801
Why are you so sensitive
all of a sudden?

1577
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,803
You want to write, write.

1578
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:38,305
Let's just not talk
about it anymore.

1579
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:42,299
Take a year. Take six months,
whatever you want.

1580
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:45,802
Who knows? Maybe you'll be
sitting with a good play.

1581
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:47,314
What's the matter?

1582
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:49,647
You look pale. Are you OK?

1583
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:54,314
Yeah. You know, I just got
dizzy all of a sudden.

1584
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:57,450
I think we need to eat.

1585
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:15,610
I can't seem to take action.

1586
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:19,205
I'm like Hamlet
unable to kill his uncle.

1587
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:22,705
I want Lee,
but I can't harm Hannah...

1588
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:26,243
and in no other area
am I a procrastinator.

1589
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:30,585
Meanwhile,
Lee has no direction.

1590
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:34,083
She's taking courses
at Columbia, but just randomly.

1591
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,097
I try not to call her...

1592
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:39,589
but then she calls me,
and then I call...

1593
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:44,094
and we try to resist meeting,
but once in a while we meet.

1594
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:48,098
Sometimes we argue because
I can't break up my marriage.

1595
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:50,111
Sometimes we wind up
making love...

1596
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:52,943
and we both feel terrible.

1597
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:54,471
But it's my fault.

1598
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:58,243
For all my education...

1599
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:01,084
accomplishments,
and so... called wisdom...

1600
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,489
I can't fathom my own heart.

1601
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:08,257
Krishna, Krishna,
Hare, Hare...

1602
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:11,265
What makes you interested
in becoming a Hare Krishna?

1603
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:13,767
I'm not saying
that I want to join...

1604
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:16,270
but I know you guys
believe in reincarnation...

1605
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:17,771
so it interests me.

1606
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,000
What's your religion?

1607
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,337
I was born Jewish...

1608
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,071
but last winter
I tried to become a Catholic.

1609
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:24,476
It didn't work for me.

1610
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:28,346
I studied and tried,
but Catholicism for me was...

1611
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,078
"Die now, pay later."

1612
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:32,586
I couldn't get with it.
I wanted to.

1613
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:33,883
You're afraid of dying?

1614
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:35,150
Yeah, naturally. Aren't you?

1615
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,886
In reincarnation,
does that mean my soul...

1616
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:39,791
would pass
to another human being...

1617
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:42,854
or would I come back as
a moose or an aardvark?

1618
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,731
Take our literature,
read it over...

1619
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:47,291
and think about it.

1620
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:48,632
Thank you very much.

1621
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,638
You're welcome. Hare Krishna.

1622
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:57,169
Who are you kidding?
You're going to be a Krishna?

1623
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,806
You're going to
shave your head, put on robes...

1624
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,577
and dance around at airports?

1625
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:03,584
You'd look like Jerry Lewis.

1626
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:06,416
Oh, God, I'm so depressed.

1627
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:19,394
The nights
are really getting cooler.

1628
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,732
Summer went so quickly.

1629
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,897
Soon it'll be fall.

1630
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,209
My literature professor
really likes me.

1631
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:31,235
It was fun being out with him
last night.

1632
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,146
Funny, I feel like
I'm betraying Elliot...

1633
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:35,649
but that's ridiculous.

1634
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:40,144
Why shouldn't I see Doug?
Elliot's not free.

1635
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:43,316
Just go one step at a time.

1636
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:46,521
Let's see what the next
few months bring.

1637
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:52,023
You'll be happy to know
that your money...

1638
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,035
has not gone completely
to waste.

1639
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:56,697
I have an actual
first rough draft...

1640
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:58,330
of something I wrote.

1641
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:03,705
I showed it to Lee.
She gave me some good pointers.

1642
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:07,704
I'm pretty near where you live.
Could I just drop it off?

1643
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:10,217
And when you have some time,
read it.

1644
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:12,719
We'll talk when I come over
at Thanksgiving.

1645
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:16,588
OK? All right.
Wait. Listen.

1646
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,593
I think Lee met
an interesting guy at Columbia.

1647
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:23,085
Yeah, yeah.
Well, he sounds really nice.

1648
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:26,259
Yeah. OK, all right.
We'll talk at Thanksgiving.

1649
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:32,631
Here's a song that Norma sang...

1650
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,700
on that trip we made
up to the show in Buffalo...

1651
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,770
and, oh, was she beautiful
that night.

1652
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:40,280
Come on.

1653
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:43,148
Yes, you were.
Don't you remember that night?

1654
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,674
She was so beautiful...

1655
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,246
that when men saw her
walking along the streets...

1656
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:52,055
they'd drive their cars
right up on the sidewalk.

1657
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:53,685
That right, honey?

1658
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,720
A slight exaggeration,
but only slight.

1659
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:26,453
You've been very cold
to me tonight.

1660
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,758
Is something wrong?

1661
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:31,265
Not here.

1662
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:34,291
There are too many people
around.

1663
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:40,299
I think Lee is really serious
about her new boyfriend.

1664
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:42,969
From what I understand,
he sounds really nice.

1665
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:46,469
I'm so happy for her.
I think she's in love.

1666
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:47,981
What's the matter?

1667
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:50,314
I'm real upset
about what you wrote.

1668
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:51,477
My script?

1669
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,987
It's obviously based
on Elliot and me.

1670
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:54,989
So loosely.

1671
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:56,820
Not so loosely.
Real specifically.

1672
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:58,826
Is that how you see us?

1673
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,829
Can I not accept gestures
and feelings from people?

1674
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,660
Do I put people off?

1675
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:06,030
- Lt's a made... up story.
- No, it's real exact.

1676
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:08,695
The situations,
the dialogue, everything.

1677
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:12,035
It's full of intimate details
between Elliot and me...

1678
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:15,201
which I don't see how
you could know about.

1679
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:17,711
A conversation we had
about adoption?

1680
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,212
Lee mentioned that to me.

1681
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:21,215
Obviously,
you discussed it with her.

1682
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:24,218
I took the essence,
blew it up into drama.

1683
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:27,915
I don't see how Lee could know.
I don't tell her everything.

1684
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,719
I guess I hit a nerve.

1685
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,351
You make it sound like
I have no needs.

1686
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:34,657
You think
I'm too self... sufficient?

1687
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,163
That's not what I meant.

1688
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:38,688
Everybody relies on you
for so much.

1689
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:41,201
You're so giving.
It's not a criticism.

1690
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:42,703
We love you. We're grateful.

1691
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:44,204
Grateful, but you resent me.

1692
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,208
Oh, wow. I don't want to
have this conversation.

1693
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:48,709
I didn't do anything wrong.

1694
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:51,712
You said you and Elliot
were having problems.

1695
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:53,873
Problems that are my business...

1696
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:57,373
which I don't see how you
could know about in such detail.

1697
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:59,852
How does Lee know about
these things? How?

1698
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:00,855
They're private.

1699
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:03,357
Why don't you share them
with us?

1700
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:04,881
I don't want to bother everyone.

1701
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:07,394
That's the point.
I'd like to be bothered.

1702
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:09,692
I don't see how you could
know about these things...

1703
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:11,665
unless Elliot's
been talking to you.

1704
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:13,394
He hasn't.

1705
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,925
If I offended you, I'm sorry.

1706
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:22,103
It's over, Elliot. I don't know
how to be any clearer.

1707
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:24,338
- I know I deserve this...
- I'm just as much at fault.

1708
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:26,438
If you could believe
I have such feelings...

1709
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:29,177
I've got to be honest
with you... I've met someone else.

1710
01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:31,481
What do you mean?

1711
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,851
I told you I wasn't
going to wait forever.

1712
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,355
It hasn't been forever.

1713
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:38,223
It's been nearly a year
since our first time.

1714
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:40,227
You're still married
to my sister.

1715
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:41,728
That's fine
because you're probably...

1716
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:44,231
more in love with her
than you know.

1717
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:45,732
We made so many plans.

1718
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:47,234
You led me on.

1719
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:49,736
I truly believed
you were unhappy with Hannah.

1720
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:52,467
I would never have
let myself be drawn in.

1721
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:54,372
I was weak. So were you.

1722
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:56,274
Now I've met someone else.

1723
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:00,410
Dinner soon?

1724
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:01,938
About fifteen minutes.

1725
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:03,780
Good.

1726
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:05,786
And you're in love overnight?

1727
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,186
I care a great deal
about him, yes.

1728
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:11,886
It's over, Elliot. I mean it.
It's over.

1729
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:16,894
Sweetheart, I loved your script.

1730
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:18,728
I thought it was so clever.

1731
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:19,892
Well, you're my mother.

1732
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,300
Not everybody's going
to be such a sucker.

1733
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,362
I particularly liked
the character of the mother...

1734
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:27,966
just a boozy old flirt
with a filthy mouth.

1735
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:29,499
I'm so proud.

1736
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:31,569
Oh, Mom. Thanks.

1737
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:33,581
Now here's a toast
to Thanksgiving.

1738
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:36,175
Are we supposed
to have beer? Yes!

1739
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:37,684
Let me hear it.

1740
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,243
How's that, Fletcher?

1741
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:42,347
Now to Thanksgiving.
Here's a little toast.

1742
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,982
Come on, bottoms up.

1743
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:47,153
Have you been talking
to Holly or Lee about us...

1744
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:48,560
about our personal life?

1745
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:50,188
Me? Of course not.

1746
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:52,699
There's things Holly wrote about
in her script...

1747
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,201
that are so personal...

1748
01:27:54,235 --> 01:27:56,703
it could only have come
from you.

1749
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:58,729
I've got a headache,
and I don't like being accused.

1750
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:03,233
I'm not accusing. I'm asking.
Do you find me too giving?

1751
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,075
Too competent?

1752
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:08,241
Too disgustingly perfect
or something?

1753
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,912
What's come between us?
How have I alienated you?

1754
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,420
Hannah, my head is throbbing.

1755
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:15,422
You never want to talk about it.

1756
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:19,085
When I bring it up,
you change the subject.

1757
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,754
We're communicating
less and less.

1758
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,319
You sleep with me less and less.

1759
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:25,423
Hannah, I am very mixed up!
Please!

1760
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:29,061
Do you talk to Holly or Lee
behind my back?

1761
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:31,571
They seem to know
so much about us.

1762
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:34,074
Well, maybe I've asked advice
once or twice or made a joke.

1763
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:37,077
Do you talk to Holly
or Lee or what?

1764
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:38,408
Do you phone them?

1765
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:39,913
Leave me alone, can't you?

1766
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:43,610
Jesus, I told you.
I need someone I can matter to.

1767
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,915
You matter to me. Completely.

1768
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:47,477
It's hard to be
around someone...

1769
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:50,889
who gives so much
and needs so little in return.

1770
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:52,392
I have enormous needs.

1771
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:55,760
I can't see them,
and neither can Lee or Holly.

1772
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:58,951
So pitch black tonight.

1773
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:02,820
I feel lost.

1774
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,929
You're not lost.

1775
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,901
I love you so much.

1776
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,596
You may not remember me...

1777
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:13,088
but we had the worst night
of my life together.

1778
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,624
I remember you.

1779
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:17,638
I was walking past,
I saw you in here...

1780
01:31:17,672 --> 01:31:19,640
and I thought we could replay...

1781
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:21,141
We didn't hit it off.

1782
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:23,143
We did everything
but exchange gunshots.

1783
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:24,371
How are you?

1784
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:26,642
Good. How are you?
You look wonderful.

1785
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:29,445
No, you do.

1786
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:32,078
Remember slamming
the cab door in my face?

1787
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:35,088
You came very dangerously close
to emasculating my nose...

1788
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:37,090
in a really horrible way.

1789
01:31:37,124 --> 01:31:39,592
That was a long time ago.

1790
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:40,787
People change.

1791
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:43,262
- I hope you've changed.
- I hope you have, too.

1792
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:46,391
Because your personality
left something to be desired...

1793
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:48,629
namely a personality.

1794
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:51,137
So how are you?
What are you doing?

1795
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:53,902
Nothing much. Just some stuff.

1796
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:55,636
A little of this,
a little of that.

1797
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:57,143
Was that
an embarrassing question?

1798
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,646
Are you out of work
or something?

1799
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,147
I've been trying to write.

1800
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:02,547
Have you?

1801
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:04,346
Well, that's interesting.
What kind of stuff?

1802
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:07,320
You're not interested in this.

1803
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:08,982
No, I am. I am.

1804
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,787
Millions of people say to you,
"I have something I just wrote."

1805
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:14,090
Nobody ever said it.

1806
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:17,325
Would you be willing
to read something I wrote?

1807
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,731
Yes, if it would
mean anything to you.

1808
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:21,758
I don't know why it would.

1809
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:23,793
You've always hated
my taste in the past.

1810
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:26,204
No, I haven't.

1811
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,141
I think it might make
a great television script...

1812
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:31,144
and you're so active
in television.

1813
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:34,636
Not anymore. I haven't been
in television for a year.

1814
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:35,649
You're kidding.

1815
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:37,446
I may have to
get back into it...

1816
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:39,715
because my account says
I'm running out of dollars...

1817
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:42,848
but, no,
I dropped out for a year...

1818
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:45,017
which is a long, dull story.

1819
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:46,185
You OK?

1820
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,660
I'm fine.

1821
01:32:47,695 --> 01:32:49,185
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

1822
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,697
What about your script?

1823
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:54,064
I'd love it if you'd read it,
because I value your opinion.

1824
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:56,399
But you have to remember
while you're reading...

1825
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:58,029
and you're cursing my name...

1826
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:01,166
that this is my first script.
Well, not my first script.

1827
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:04,234
My first script was about Hannah
and her husband...

1828
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:08,044
but Hannah read it
and got really angry.

1829
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:09,743
I can't imagine what you wrote.

1830
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:13,242
It wasn't anything bad,
but she just... I don't know.

1831
01:33:13,287 --> 01:33:16,745
So I threw it out,
but I have this other one.

1832
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:19,760
If you want me to, I'll read it.

1833
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:22,695
Could I come over tomorrow
and read it to you?

1834
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:26,530
Come over and read it to me?
You must be joking.

1835
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:29,934
I've done my own reading
since I was forty.

1836
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:32,701
It's lucky I ran into you...
maybe.

1837
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,174
What about me?
I should have kept going.

1838
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:37,677
I have a nagging sensation...

1839
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:41,648
that I should have kept walking
and not begun this conversation.

1840
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:45,379
"We all go through life
playing the hand we're dealt.

1841
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:48,786
"Craig...
And what hand were you dealt?

1842
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:51,417
"Emily... I'm two high pair.

1843
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:53,518
"Maybe even aces up.

1844
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:56,553
"The problem is
you've got three deuces."

1845
01:33:58,032 --> 01:33:59,522
That's the end.

1846
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:03,994
No, you can tell me straight.
It's OK.

1847
01:34:04,038 --> 01:34:06,506
Just tell me what you think.

1848
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:07,768
It's great.

1849
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:12,268
I swe... I'm...
I'm speechless. I was...

1850
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:16,272
I was not in the mood
to listen to this thing now.

1851
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:19,775
I don't know what to say.
I'm moved, and I laughed...

1852
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,789
and I was on the edge
of my seat.

1853
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:24,290
I just think it's wonderful.

1854
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:25,792
I'm totally... stunned.

1855
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,225
This is not an insult.

1856
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:29,229
I'm amazed that you can...

1857
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:31,231
I just thought it was great.

1858
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:32,254
Really?

1859
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:33,766
Yes, I was absolutely...

1860
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:36,770
And what made you think
of that climax scene...

1861
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:39,637
where the architect
is walking home...

1862
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:41,005
with his actress girlfriend...

1863
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:43,476
and the ex... wife schizophrenic
jumps out of the bushes...

1864
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:44,773
and stabs them to death?

1865
01:34:44,812 --> 01:34:46,609
It just came to me one day.

1866
01:34:46,647 --> 01:34:48,774
Well, it was just fabulous.

1867
01:34:48,816 --> 01:34:50,784
You really think I can write?

1868
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:54,276
There's maybe one or two things
I'd do differently myself...

1869
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:55,788
but who cares?

1870
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:58,291
It was fabulous.

1871
01:34:58,325 --> 01:35:00,316
I mean it. I'm so impressed.

1872
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,829
I am. You made my day.

1873
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:04,330
It was just great.

1874
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:06,833
I was set to be bored stiff.

1875
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,835
Would you like to have lunch?

1876
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:11,838
I'd love to talk to you
about that script.

1877
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,340
I think we could
do something with it.

1878
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,343
And I'd like to hear...

1879
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,845
what made you suddenly
drop out of life.

1880
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:21,347
- Who cares?
- No. I care.

1881
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:23,850
You used to be so ambitious,
and...

1882
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,045
God, you really liked it?

1883
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:51,344
Gosh, you really went
through a crisis, you know that?

1884
01:35:51,378 --> 01:35:53,346
How did you get over it?

1885
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:56,543
When I ran into you,
you seemed just perfectly fine.

1886
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:58,552
Well, you seem fine now.

1887
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,349
Well, I'll tell you.

1888
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:04,050
One day, about a month ago,
I really hit bottom.

1889
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:06,559
I just felt that
in a godless universe...

1890
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:08,858
I didn't want to go on living.

1891
01:36:08,896 --> 01:36:10,659
I happen to own this rifle...

1892
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:12,893
which I loaded,
believe it or not...

1893
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,400
and pressed it to my forehead.

1894
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,960
I remember thinking,
"I'm going to kill myself."

1895
01:36:17,004 --> 01:36:19,802
Then I thought,
"Well, what if I'm wrong?

1896
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,071
"What if there is a god?
Nobody really knows."

1897
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:26,568
Then I thought, "No.
Maybe is not good enough.

1898
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:29,174
"I want certainty or nothing."

1899
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:32,310
And I remember very clearly
the clock was ticking...

1900
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:35,720
and I was sitting there frozen
with the gun to my head...

1901
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:38,281
debating whether to shoot.

1902
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:41,990
All of a sudden,
the gun went off.

1903
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:43,326
I'd been so tense...

1904
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:45,730
my finger had squeezed
the trigger inadvertently.

1905
01:36:45,766 --> 01:36:47,893
But I was perspiring so much...

1906
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:51,200
the gun had slid off my forehead
and missed me.

1907
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:54,605
Suddenly, neighbors
were pounding on the door...

1908
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:58,339
and the whole scene
was just pandemonium.

1909
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,609
And, you know,
I ran to the door.

1910
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:04,277
I didn't know what to say.
I was embarrassed and confused.

1911
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:06,786
My mind was racing
a mile a minute.

1912
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:10,951
I just knew one thing...
I had to get out of that house.

1913
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:14,927
I had to get out in
the fresh air and clear my head.

1914
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:17,829
And I remember very clearly,
I walked the streets.

1915
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:18,923
I walked and walked.

1916
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:21,230
I didn't know what
was going through my mind.

1917
01:37:21,268 --> 01:37:25,102
It all seemed so violent
and unreal to me.

1918
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:28,165
I wandered for a long time
on the Upper West Side.

1919
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:29,836
It must have been hours.

1920
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:32,846
My feet hurt.
My head was pounding.

1921
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,507
I had to sit down.

1922
01:37:34,548 --> 01:37:36,880
I went into a movie house.
I didn't know what was playing.

1923
01:37:36,917 --> 01:37:41,286
I just needed a moment to gather
my thoughts and be logical...

1924
01:37:41,322 --> 01:37:45,156
and put the world back
into rational perspective.

1925
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:56,069
And I went upstairs
to the balcony...

1926
01:37:56,103 --> 01:37:57,730
and I sat down.

1927
01:37:57,771 --> 01:38:01,468
The movie was a film I'd seen
many times in my life...

1928
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:02,736
since I was a kid...

1929
01:38:02,776 --> 01:38:04,903
and I always loved it.

1930
01:38:04,945 --> 01:38:07,413
I'm watching these people
up on the screen...

1931
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:10,849
and I started getting
hooked on the film, you know?

1932
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:13,046
And I started to feel...

1933
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:15,555
"How can you even think
of killing yourself?

1934
01:38:15,589 --> 01:38:17,386
"Isn't it so stupid?

1935
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:19,949
"Look at all the people
up there on the screen.

1936
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:23,589
"They're real funny,
and what if the worst is true...

1937
01:38:23,631 --> 01:38:27,067
"there's no god, and you only
go around once, and that's it?

1938
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:30,366
"Don't you want to be
part of the experience?

1939
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,872
"What the hell?
It's not all a drag."

1940
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,966
And I'm thinking to myself...

1941
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:37,000
"Jeez, I should stop
ruining my life...

1942
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:39,512
"searching for answers
I'm never going to get...

1943
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:42,515
"and just enjoy it
while it lasts.

1944
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:44,210
"And after, who knows?

1945
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:46,549
"Maybe there is something.
Nobody really knows.

1946
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:49,454
"I know maybe
is a very slim reed...

1947
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:51,014
"to hang your whole life on...

1948
01:38:51,058 --> 01:38:53,219
"but that's the best we have."

1949
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,728
And then I started
to sit back...

1950
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:58,960
and I actually began
to enjoy myself.

1951
01:38:58,999 --> 01:39:00,626
Hello, Freedonia

1952
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:02,465
Oh, don't you cry for me

1953
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:04,698
I'm a... comin' round the mountain

1954
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:10,437
There's something that's been
bothering me for a long time...

1955
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:13,378
and I thought
I'd tell you what it was...

1956
01:39:13,414 --> 01:39:16,144
and clear the deck here,
and that's this...

1957
01:39:16,183 --> 01:39:18,947
I've always regretted
the way I behaved...

1958
01:39:18,986 --> 01:39:21,011
that evening we went out.

1959
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:22,454
I just thought I'd tell you.

1960
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:24,582
I really made a fool
out of myself.

1961
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,092
No, don't be ridiculous.

1962
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:30,119
I was...
You know, it was my fault.

1963
01:39:30,164 --> 01:39:33,258
So you want to go out to dinner
again?

1964
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,291
You have any interest in that,
or...

1965
01:39:35,336 --> 01:39:36,303
Sure. Sure.

1966
01:39:36,337 --> 01:39:38,828
Do you?
Are you free this evening?

1967
01:39:46,547 --> 01:39:49,015
I want ice. Who's got some...

1968
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:50,676
- Oh, there.
- Lt's on the table, Dad.

1969
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:52,345
Where's Holly? She's late.

1970
01:39:52,386 --> 01:39:54,718
Hannah, did you read
that last thing Holly wrote?

1971
01:39:54,755 --> 01:39:56,017
It's great.
She's really developed.

1972
01:39:56,056 --> 01:39:58,183
She really writes good dialogue.

1973
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:00,659
Hannah, can I tell everybody
you're going to play Desdemona?

1974
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:02,855
Mom, it's only television.

1975
01:40:02,896 --> 01:40:04,625
It's public television.

1976
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:07,190
Shakespeare doesn't get
any greater than "Othello."

1977
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:09,065
You with some big black stud.

1978
01:40:09,103 --> 01:40:10,229
I love it.

1979
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:11,897
Oh, honey!

1980
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:40,562
Oh, Lee, you are something.

1981
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:43,195
You look very beautiful.

1982
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:46,199
Marriage agrees with you.

1983
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,169
Everything
that happened between us...

1984
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:53,202
seems more and more hazy.

1985
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:56,679
I acted like such a fool.

1986
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:59,185
I don't know what came over me.

1987
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:03,349
The complete conviction that
I couldn't live without you.

1988
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:06,223
What I put us both through.

1989
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,491
And Hannah,
who, as you once said...

1990
01:41:09,530 --> 01:41:12,021
I loved much more
than I realized.

1991
01:41:17,438 --> 01:41:19,269
Happy Thanksgiving!

1992
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:23,766
Daisy.
I didn't miss dinner, did I?

1993
01:41:24,778 --> 01:41:26,746
Hi, Marge. Happy Thanksgiving.

1994
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,680
- Hello, darling.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

1995
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:29,875
Thank you.

1996
01:42:32,045 --> 01:42:33,535
Beautiful.

1997
01:42:37,251 --> 01:42:39,845
Don't get nervous.
It's just your husband.

1998
01:42:39,887 --> 01:42:42,219
Hi. How you doing?
When'd you get here?

1999
01:42:42,256 --> 01:42:44,417
A few minutes ago.

2000
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:46,517
You look so beautiful.

2001
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:49,028
I was talking
to your father before...

2002
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:51,530
and I was telling him
that it's ironic...

2003
01:42:51,565 --> 01:42:54,033
I used to always have
Thanksgiving with Hannah...

2004
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:57,298
and I never thought
I could love anybody else...

2005
01:42:57,337 --> 01:42:59,134
and here it is years later...

2006
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:00,731
and I'm married to you...

2007
01:43:00,774 --> 01:43:03,242
and completely in love with you.

2008
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:06,735
The heart is a very,
very resilient little muscle.

2009
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:09,214
It really is.

2010
01:43:09,249 --> 01:43:11,080
Make a great story, I think.

2011
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:12,949
Guy marries one sister.

2012
01:43:12,986 --> 01:43:14,419
Doesn't work out.

2013
01:43:14,454 --> 01:43:18,788
Then years later, he winds up
married to the other sister.

2014
01:43:18,825 --> 01:43:22,056
How you going to top that?

2015
01:43:24,898 --> 01:43:26,058
What?

2016
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:28,464
I'm pregnant.

2017
01:46:53,007 --> 01:46:54,464
