00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:48,413
<i>"Chapter one. "</i>

2
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:52,750
<i>"He adored New York City.
He idolised it all out of proportion. "</i>

3
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:57,630
<i>Uh, no. Make that "He romanticised it
all out of proportion. "</i>

4
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:00,216
<i>"To him,
no matter what the season was, </i>

5
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:03,595
<i>this was still a town
that existed in black and white</i>

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,015
<i>and pulsated to the great tunes
of George Gershwin. "</i>

7
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,684
<i>Uh... no. Let me start this over. </i>

8
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:11,936
<i>"Chapter one. "</i>

9
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:15,982
<i>"He was too romantic about Manhattan,
as he was about everything else. "</i>

10
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:19,736
<i>"He thrived on the hustle, bustle
of the crowds and the traffic. "</i>

11
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:22,113
<i>"To him, New York
meant beautiful women</i>

12
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:26,075
<i>and street-smart guys
who seemed to know all the angles. "</i>

13
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:29,496
<i>Ah, corny. Too corny
for a man of my taste. </i>

14
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:31,956
<i>Let me... try and make it more profound. </i>

15
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:35,877
<i>"Chapter one. He adored New York City. "</i>

16
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:40,340
<i>"To him, it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture. "</i>

17
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:44,636
<i>"The same lack of integrity to cause so
many people to take the easy way out... </i>

18
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,639
<i>... was rapidly turning the town
of his dreams..."</i>

19
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:52,101
<i>No, it's gonna be too preachy. I mean,
face it, I wanna sell some books here. </i>

20
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:55,063
<i>"Chapter one. He adored New York City, </i>

21
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:59,609
<i>although to him it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture. "</i>

22
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:05,114
<i>"How hard it was to exist in a society
desensitised by drugs, loud music, </i>

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,076
<i>television, crime, garbage..."</i>

24
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:10,411
<i>Too angry. I don't wanna be angry. </i>

25
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:12,872
<i>"Chapter one. "</i>

26
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:16,042
<i>"He was as tough and romantic
as the city he loved. "</i>

27
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:20,922
<i>"Behind his black-rimmed glasses was
the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat. "</i>

28
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:22,632
<i>I love this. </i>

29
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:26,219
<i>"New York was his town
and it always would be. "</i>

30
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:27,382
I think the essence of art is to provide
a kind of working-through situation,

31
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:31,052
so that you can get in touch
with feelings you didn't know you had.

32
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:35,515
Talent is luck.
The important thing in life is courage.

33
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,936
- They've had this argument for 20 years.
- Listen to this example.

34
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:45,024
If the four of us are walking home over
the bridge and a person was drowning,

35
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,193
would we have the nerve...

36
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:51,156
Would one of us have the nerve
to dive into the icy water and save them?

37
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,116
It's a key question.

38
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:56,036
l, of course, can't swim,
so I never have to face it.

39
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:58,955
Oh... God.

40
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,666
Which of us?

41
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:05,503
- You want a little more?
- No.

42
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:09,466
Mm. Oh, man. That is so great.

43
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:11,426
You don't smoke.

44
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,097
I know I don't smoke. I don't inhale
because it gives you cancer, but

45
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:21,644
<i>I look so incredibly handsome
with a cigarette that I can't not hold one.</i>

46
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:25,315
You like the way I look?

47
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,858
Provocative.

48
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:30,904
- I'm getting through to you?
- Yup. You have to excuse me a sec.

49
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:35,408
Jesus, she's gorgeous.

50
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:38,370
But she's 17.

51
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:40,789
I'm 42 and she's 17.

52
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:45,919
I'm... I'm older than her father.
Can you believe that?

53
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:49,506
I'm dating a girl
wherein I can beat up her father.

54
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,634
That's the first time
that ever occurred in my life.

55
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,013
- He's drunk.
- You're drunk. You should never drink.

56
00:05:57,138 --> 00:06:00,725
Did I tell you... that my ex-wife...

57
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,562
- Who, Tina?
- My second ex-wife

58
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:08,525
is writing a book about
our marriage and the break-up.

59
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,903
- That's really tacky.
- It's really depressing, you know.

60
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:16,658
She's gonna give all those details out,
all my little idiosyncrasies,

61
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,285
and my quirks and mannerisms, and...

62
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,289
Not that I have
anything to hide because, you know...

63
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:27,961
But there are a few disgusting
little moments that I regret.

64
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:31,006
It's just gossip.
Gossip is the new pornography.

65
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:34,634
- You should never let me drink.
- I know.

66
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,012
<i>You should never let yourself drink.</i>

67
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:39,806
We oughta go
cos I've got an exam tomorrow.

68
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:42,392
Oh, do you? The kid's gotta get up...

69
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:47,605
She's got homework.
I'm dating a girl who does homework.

70
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:51,151
What is it? What's the matter with you?

71
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:55,280
You... you... Where are you now?
Your mind is like a million miles away.

72
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,449
I have something I wanna say.

73
00:06:57,574 --> 00:07:00,493
l, uh, I just didn't know
quite how to... get into it.

74
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,662
Um, l, uh...

75
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,959
About seven or eight weeks ago
I went to this dinner party

76
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:10,128
and I met a woman there.

77
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,214
And...

78
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,969
- And I've got kind of involved with her.
- You're kidding?

79
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:21,806
It started out very casually.
I mean, we had lunch a couple of times.

80
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:26,394
And now it's, you know, it's getting out of
hand and I don't know what to do about it.

81
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,647
I mean, I'm... It's scary.

82
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,816
Well, who is she? What are the details?

83
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:33,985
Well, she's a journalist.

84
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:35,904
She's very...

85
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,490
- Is she married, too?
- No, no.

86
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:40,659
She's very beautiful.

87
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:45,038
She's very kind of
nervous, high-strung, illusive.

88
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:47,624
Great. It sounds wonderful.

89
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:52,128
<i>Oh, she is wonderful.
I mean, she's on my mind all the time.</i>

90
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:57,050
What are you telling me? That your
marriage is... I mean, how serious is it?

91
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:01,930
I don't know, but it's pretty serious.

92
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:05,517
- But you haven't said anything to Emily?
- No! God, no.

93
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:09,145
It's amazing. I'm stunned
because, of all the people I know,

94
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:13,400
I always thought for sure that you
and Emily had one of the best marriages.

95
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,902
We do! I mean, I love her.

96
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,446
- But you're seeing...
- I know it.

97
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:21,366
But in all the years
that we've been married

98
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:25,745
I've had, what... one or two
very minor things with other women.

99
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:31,835
I mean, very... I hate the whole idea. I hate
myself when I'm doing this sort of thing.

100
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,046
But this is just, you know...
This is not like that.

101
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:38,633
It's terrible. Listen,
you shouldn't ask me for advice.

102
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:43,805
When it comes to relationships, I'm the
winner of the August Strindberg Award.

103
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,560
Well, I don't think 17 is too young.
Beside that, she's a bright girl.

104
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:52,063
You'll get no argument from me.
I think she's terrific.

105
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:55,442
<i>He could do a lot worse.
He has done a lot worse.</i>

106
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,819
I just think he's wasting his life.

107
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:01,031
He writes that crap for television.

108
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,036
Yale, have you ever thought
any more about having kids?

109
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:09,080
Oh, my God. Kids.

110
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:13,126
Listen, I've gotta get this book finished.
It's never gonna get done.

111
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:16,588
I've gotta get the money
to get this magazine started, huh?

112
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:18,340
Kids...

113
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:22,135
We always talk about moving to
Connecticut. You could do it there.

114
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,721
- Connecticut.
- Yeah.

115
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:28,099
I can't go to Connecticut. It's not practical.

116
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,268
All my stuff's here.

117
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:32,896
My work's here.
It's just the wrong time.

118
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:36,524
What about Isaac?
We can't abandon him, you know?

119
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,695
He can't function anywhere
other than New York, you know that.

120
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,864
Very Freudian.

121
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:03,802
- Are you writing a book on our marriage?
- Leave me alone.

122
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:08,306
- Are you writing about our break-up?
- We've said all that needs to be said.

123
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:11,309
I know you are because
I have a friend at Random House.

124
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:14,729
- I'm free to do as I please.
- Yeah, but this affects me.

125
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:18,567
So you're gonna tell everybody
everything? Our life, our sexual life?

126
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:20,110
Do you spy on me?

127
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:23,905
No. I was at a party and a guy said
he read an advance chapter

128
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,784
of a book my wife was writing,
and it was hot stuff. He said that!

129
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:31,830
- I spilled wine on my pants.
- I don't care to discuss it.

130
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:34,499
- You won't discuss it. How's Willie?
- Fine.

131
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:39,004
Well, give me some details. Does he
play baseball? Wear dresses? What?

132
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:43,675
He doesn't wear dresses. You'll find out
the details when it's your turn to see him.

133
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,803
Don't write this book.
It's a humiliating experience.

134
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,264
It's an honest account of our break-up.

135
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,601
Jesus, everybody that knows us
is gonna know everything.

136
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,978
Look at you. You're so threatened.

137
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:00,108
I'm not threatened because I was not
the immoral, psychotic, promiscuous one.

138
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,611
I hope I didn't leave out anything.

139
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:13,413
Are you telling me that... that... that I'm...
that you had three affairs before me?

140
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:17,042
That's really hard to believe.
It's mind-boggling.

141
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:21,296
When I was your age, I was still being
tucked in by my grandparents.

142
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:25,592
Well, they were really immature boys.
They were nothing like you.

143
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,761
No? What does that mean?

144
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:31,014
Well, I told you before.
I think I'm in love with you.

145
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,433
Hey, don't get carried away, OK?

146
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:37,103
This is... This is a terrific thing
- Move over-you know.

147
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:42,901
And we're having a great time, but you're
a kid and I never want you to forget that.

148
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:45,987
You're gonna meet
a lot of terrific men in your life

149
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:48,281
and, you know, I want you to enjoy me.

150
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:52,494
My wry sense of humour
and astonishing sexual technique,

151
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:56,665
but never forget that you've...
you've got your whole life ahead of you.

152
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't you have any feelings for me?

153
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:02,712
How can you ask that?
I've got nothing but feelings for you,

154
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:06,508
but you don't wanna get hung up
with one person at your age.

155
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:09,845
It's... charming, you know.

156
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,014
Erotic. No question about that.

157
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,561
As long as the cops don't burst in, I think
we're gonna break a couple of records.

158
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:21,064
But you can't, uh, you can't...
It's not a good thing.

159
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:25,527
You should think of me sort of
as a detour on the highway of life.

160
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:29,322
- So get dressed because you gotta go.
- Don't you want me to stay over?

161
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,700
I don't want you to get in the habit

162
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:36,872
because first you stay one night, then
two nights, and then you're living here.

163
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:39,708
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It's not a great idea.

164
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,378
You won't like it, believe me.
I'm tough to get along with.

165
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:48,383
Tomorrow we'll go to the cinema and I'll
show you the Veronica Lake movie. OK?

166
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:52,179
OK. Veronica Lake's
the pin-up with the red hair?

167
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:56,224
<i>No, that's Rita Hayworth.
Do we have to go over this all the time?</i>

168
00:12:56,349 --> 00:13:00,145
- Rita who?
- Rita Hayworth. Are you joking with me?

169
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,025
Course I'm joking! You think I'm unaware
of any event pre-Paul McCartney.

170
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:10,906
- I find these photographs interesting.
- Yes, so do I.

171
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:14,701
- Do you ever use the camera I got you?
- Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.

172
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:18,497
I was taking pictures in our drama class.
It's fun, really neat.

173
00:13:18,622 --> 00:13:21,458
<i>You know you sound like
the mouse in Tom And Jerry. </i>

174
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,001
Are you kidding me?

175
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:26,713
- You should talk! You've a whiny voice!
- You sound like the mouse.

176
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,673
Well, thanks.

177
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,927
I know, I'm a whiner.

178
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,306
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

179
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:39,392
- How long have you been here?
- We were talking about you.

180
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:43,980
That's hilarious. Wh... What... Were you
walking around behind us or what?

181
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:47,359
- How are you? Hi.
- Good. That's funny. We were talking...

182
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:50,445
We're gonna go to
the Shakespeare In The Park thing.

183
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,614
Oh, yeah, right. I wanna do that.

184
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:56,326
Oh, this is my friend.
Mary Wilke, Isaac Davis and Tracy.

185
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:58,537
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

186
00:13:58,662 --> 00:13:59,955
You, too.

187
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,706
- Hello.
- Hi.

188
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:04,876
We were downstairs.
We saw the photography exhibition.

189
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:07,629
- Absolutely incredible.
- It's really good.

190
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,214
Really?

191
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:11,967
- The photographs downstairs?
- Yes.

192
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:17,264
- Great. Absolutely great. Did you?
- No, I really felt it was very derivative.

193
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,935
To me it looked like it was straight out of
Diane Arbus, but it had none of the wit.

194
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,772
Well, we didn't like it
as much as the Plexiglas sculpture.

195
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,691
You liked the Plexiglas?

196
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:33,947
- You didn't like the Plexiglas either?
- Ah, that's interesting. Nah, no...

197
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:37,617
It was a lot better than
that... that steel cube. Did you see it?

198
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,830
- Oh, yeah. That was the worst.
- Now that was brilliant to me.

199
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:43,999
- The cube was brilliant?
- Yes.

200
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:47,210
To me it was very textural.
You know what I mean?

201
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:52,090
It was perfectly integrated and it had a...
a marvellous kind of negative capability.

202
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,259
The rest of the stuff was bullshit.

203
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:01,224
- You wanna see the Sol Lewitt?
- Sure. That'd be fun.

204
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:02,768
You wanna see that?

205
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:06,438
<i>He opens at the Modern soon. I was
gonna do a piece on Sol for Insights. </i>

206
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:09,524
Do you know that magazine?
It's a little magazine.

207
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,779
They're such schmucks up there.
Really mired in Thirties radicalism.

208
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:16,281
- What do you do, Tracy?
- I go to high school.

209
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:21,370
Oh, really. Really. Somewhere Nabokov
is smiling, if you know what I mean.

210
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:25,957
LeWitt is overrated. In fact,
he may be a candidate for the academy.

211
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,417
Right!

212
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:31,797
Mary and I have invented the Academy
of the Overrated for such notables as

213
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:35,092
- Gustav Mahler,
- Isak Dinesen and Carl Jung.

214
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:38,720
- Scott Fitzgerald.
- Lenny Bruce. Can't forget him, can we?

215
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:42,641
- How about Norman Mailer?
- I think those people are all terrific.

216
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:46,520
- Who was that guy you had?
- I didn't. It was yours. Heinrich B?l.

217
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,314
- Overrated?
- Don't wanna leave out Heinrich.

218
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,901
Gee, what about Mozart?
You guys don't wanna leave out Mozart.

219
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:56,863
<i>- Well, how about Vincent Van Goch?
- She said "Van Goch"?! </i>

220
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:59,282
- Or Ingmar Bergman?
- You'll get in trouble.

221
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:02,577
Bergman? Bergman's the only genius
in cinema today, I think.

222
00:16:02,703 --> 00:16:04,538
He's a big Bergman fan.

223
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,500
God, you're so the opposite.
You write that fabulous television show.

224
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,461
It's so funny and
his view is so Scandinavian.

225
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:14,631
It's bleak, my God.
I mean, all that Kierkegaard, right?

226
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:19,803
Real adolescent, fashionable pessimism.
I mean, the silence. God's silence.

227
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:25,267
OK, OK, OK. I mean, I loved it when I was
at Radcliffe, but, all right, you outgrow it.

228
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:28,770
Get her away from me. I don't think
I can take too much more of her.

229
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:31,398
- She's really a cr...
- No. Don't you guys see?

230
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:35,193
It is the dignifying of one's
psychological and sexual hang-ups

231
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,197
by attaching them to these
grandiose, philosophical issues?

232
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:42,576
- Here we are.
- Listen, it was very nice meeting you.

233
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,579
It was a pleasure
and a sincere sensation,

234
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,665
but we have to go.
We gotta do some shopping. I forgot.

235
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,835
Hey, listen, I don't even
wanna have this conversation.

236
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,423
I'm just from Philadelphia, you know.
I mean, we believe in God so... OK?

237
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,176
What the hell does that mean?
What do you mean?

238
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:02,596
- Well, that...
- "I'm from Philadelphia. I believe in God."

239
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,599
Does this make any sense to you?

240
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:09,102
What a creep. Could you believe her?

241
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:11,772
- I mean, she was really...
- She seemed nervous.

242
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:16,443
Nervous? She was overbearing. She was,
you know, terrible! She was all cerebral.

243
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,989
Where the hell does a little Radcliffe
tootsie come off rating Scott Fitzgerald,

244
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:24,618
- Gustav Mahler and Heinrich B?l?
- Why are you getting so mad?

245
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,372
Because I don't like that
pseudo-intellectual garbage.

246
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:32,334
<i>"Van Goch!" Did you hear that? She said
Van Goch.  Like an Arab she spoke.</i>

247
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:37,297
One more remark about Bergman, and I'd
have knocked her other contact lens out.

248
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:41,468
- Is she Yale's mistress?
- That will never cease to mystify me.

249
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:46,640
I mean, he's got a wonderful wife
and he prefers to... to diddle this yo-yo.

250
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,476
But he was always a sucker
for those kind of women.

251
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:54,189
The kind that would involve him
in discussions of existential reality.

252
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:57,609
They probably sit on the floor
with wine and cheese,

253
00:17:57,734 --> 00:18:01,196
and mispronounce
"allegorical" and "didacticism".

254
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,991
I get the feeling that Yale really likes her.

255
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,119
Well, I don't believe
in extramarital relationships.

256
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:11,248
I think people should mate for life
like pigeons or Catholics.

257
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:16,336
I don't know. Maybe people weren't
meant to have one deep relationship.

258
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:20,757
Maybe we're meant to have a series
of relationships of different lengths.

259
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,845
- That's gone out of date.
- Don't tell me what's gone out of date.

260
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,557
You're 17 7. You were brought up
on drugs and television and the pill.

261
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:31,268
I... I was World War II.
I was in the trenches.

262
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:35,105
- You were eight in World War II.
- Right. I was never in the trenches.

263
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,692
I was caught right in the middle.
It was a very tough position.

264
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,819
Get the groceries, will you?

265
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,741
<i>Good morning and welcome to
Human Beings Wow! </i>

266
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:49,786
We're talking this evening with Gregory
and Caroline Payne Whitney Smith,

267
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,955
close friends of the Carter family.

268
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,167
We're normal people.
Just like you, we're in debt.

269
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,086
Except that Mrs Payne Whitney Smith
is a catatonic.

270
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:01,715
Well, we don't consider her
a catatonic, just quiet.

271
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:06,428
Jesus, this is the worst.
This is really embarrassing to me.

272
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:12,434
- I mean, I... This is so antiseptic...
- No, wrong. That's very chancy material.

273
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,979
- How do you see this as chancy?
- Who fights more with the censor?

274
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:20,359
What has the censor got to do with it?
There's no substance to the comedy.

275
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:24,613
- You don't find this insightful?
- Worse than not insightful. It's not funny.

276
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:27,532
- There's not a legitimate laugh.
- That's funny.

277
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:31,078
- Look at the audience.
- You're going by audience reaction?

278
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,247
This is an audience raised on TV.

279
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,583
Their standards have been lowered
over the years.

280
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:41,421
They watch their sets and the gamma
rays eat the white cells of their brains out.

281
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,425
- I quit. I can't write this any more.
- Relax. Take a lude.

282
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:50,430
I don't want a lude. All you do is drop
ludes, then Percodans and angel dust.

283
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:54,560
Naturally, it seems funny.
Anything would if you're...

284
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:58,480
You should abandon the show
and open a pharmaceutical house. I quit.

285
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:00,440
Ike, you're being silly.

286
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,653
<i>We've talked to them about that. </i>

287
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:07,239
<i>- Don't break her neck.
- I won't. That's fine. </i>

288
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,700
What did I do? I made a terrible mistake.

289
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:13,996
- It's the first smart thing you've done.
- I've screwed myself up completely.

290
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:18,917
For about 30 seconds I was a big hero,
and now it's directly to unemployment.

291
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,295
If you need money, I'll take care of it.

292
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,964
That's not the point.
I got enough for a year.

293
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,009
If I live like Mahatma Gandhi, I'm fine.

294
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:31,054
My accountant says I did this
at a very bad time. My stocks are down.

295
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:34,349
I'm cash poor or something.
I got no cash flow.

296
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:39,021
I'm not liquid, something's not flowing.
They got a language all their own.

297
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:42,733
We discussed this. It's difficult
to live here without a big income.

298
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:47,779
Yeah, plus I got two alimonies and
child support. You know, I gotta cut down.

299
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,990
I'll have to give up my apartment.

300
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,535
I'm not gonna be able to
play tennis, pick checks up at dinner,

301
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,704
or take the Southampton house.

302
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:02,503
Plus I'll probably have to give
my parents less money. It'll kill my father.

303
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,797
He's not gonna be able to get
as good a seat in the synagogue.

304
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:08,884
He'll be in the back, away from God,
far from the action.

305
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,053
Have you said anything to Tracy?

306
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:17,309
What is it... I gotta get out of that situation.
She's a young girl. What am I...? I'm...

307
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,270
You know, it's ridiculous. I mean, I...

308
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:24,733
What happens if the year goes by
and my book doesn't come out?

309
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:28,529
Your book is gonna come out.
Your book is gonna be wonderful.

310
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,741
The worst thing that can happen is
you'll learn something about yourself.

311
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:38,163
<i>Listen, I'm really proud of you.
I mean, this is a very good move.</i>

312
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:40,666
This is a wonderful turnout.

313
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,586
The Museum of Modern Art
has been very generous.

314
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:48,173
And the proof of the strength
of the Equal Rights Amendment

315
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:53,387
is that so many of you who would
never do it before put on black tie tonight.

316
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,978
We love you for it.
We need you and you've come through.

317
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:04,189
And now no more talk. Enjoy yourselves.

318
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:10,946
Hi. What are you doing here?

319
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:13,824
Congratulations on your book.
It was terrific.

320
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:16,243
- Oh, thanks.
- Absolutely terrific.

321
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:20,747
- Listen, I'd like you to meet Isaac Davis.
- Hi, how do you do? Isaac Davis.

322
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:24,501
- Isaac, hello. Hi.
- Wh-what are you doing here?

323
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,670
Well, of course I'm here.

324
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:31,633
What a funny coincidence.
Excuse me, Isaac Davis. We met before.

325
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:34,636
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's all right.

326
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:37,347
I heard you... quit your job.

327
00:22:37,473 --> 00:22:41,602
Yeah. A real self-destructive impulse.
I wanna write a book, so I...

328
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:45,773
Has anybody read that Nazis are gonna
march in New Jersey, you know?

329
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,358
We should go there,
get some guys together.

330
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,695
Get some bricks and baseball bats
and explain things to 'em.

331
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,616
<i>There was this devastating
satirical piece on that in the Times. </i>

332
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:00,954
<i>Well, a satirical piece in the Times is
one thing, but bricks get right to the point.</i>

333
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,041
But biting satire
is better that physical force.

334
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:09,379
No, physical force is better with Nazis.
It's hard to satirise a guy with shiny boots.

335
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:13,300
- Well, you get emotional, but...
- We were talking about orgasms.

336
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,303
- Oh, no, please!
- Really? I'm sorry. I didn't...

337
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,890
I'm from Philadelphia.
We never talk about such things in public.

338
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:23,185
You said that before.
I don't know what it meant then either.

339
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,688
I'm just about to direct a film...
of my own script.

340
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:29,733
The premise is this guy screws so great...

341
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:32,111
<i>- Screws so great?
- Screws so great</i>

342
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:36,657
<i>that when he brings a woman to orgasm,
she's so fulfilled that she dies.</i>

343
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,868
Now this one, excuse me,
finds this hostile.

344
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:43,497
It's worse than hostile.
It's aggressive-homicidal.

345
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:47,793
You have to forgive Dennis.
He's Harvard direct to Beverly Hills.

346
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:51,588
It's... Theodor Reik
with a touch of Charles Manson.

347
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:57,302
I finally had an orgasm and my doctor
told me it was the wrong kind.

348
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,890
Did you have the wrong kind?
I've never had the wrong kind. Ever.

349
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:04,393
My worst one was right on the money.

350
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:13,944
- Good night. It was nice to meet you.
- Same here.

351
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:15,904
Bye-bye.

352
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:18,490
Oh, gee!

353
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:22,911
It's an interesting group of people.
Like the cast of a Fellini movie.

354
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:26,915
They're such fun, such wonderful people,
and Helen is a good friend.

355
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:30,252
She's a brilliant woman. She's a genius.

356
00:24:30,377 --> 00:24:32,880
I met her through
my ex-husband Jeremiah.

357
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:35,883
How come you guys got divorced?
I never...

358
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,469
What do you mean
"How come we got divorced?"

359
00:24:38,594 --> 00:24:41,305
What kind of a question is that?
I hardly know you.

360
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:46,393
- You don't have to tell me if you don't...
- Well, we had problems. We fought a lot.

361
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:51,482
I was tired of submerging my identity to
a brilliant, dominating man. He's a genius.

362
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:56,487
He was a genius, Helen's a genius, Dennis
is a genius. You know a lot of geniuses.

363
00:24:56,612 --> 00:25:00,324
You should meet some stupid people.
You could learn something.

364
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,493
Well, why'd you get a divorce?

365
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:07,373
Why? I got a divorce because my ex-wife
left me for another woman.

366
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:09,124
Really?

367
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:13,962
- God, that must have been demoralising.
- I took it well under the circumstances.

368
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:17,007
- Phew-wee.
- I tried to run 'em both over with a car.

369
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:19,468
That's incredible sexual humiliation.

370
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:23,263
It's enough to turn you off women
and it accounts for the little girl.

371
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,768
Hey, the little girl is fine.
Jesus, she's... What's with the little girl?

372
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:32,106
Oh, sure. I understand, believe me.
17 years old, no possible threat at all.

373
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:36,985
She's 17. She's gonna be eight...
Sometimes you have a losing personality.

374
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:41,448
I'm honest. I say what's on my mind
and if you can't take it, then fuck off.

375
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:45,244
I like the way you express yourself, too.
Pithy, yet degenerate.

376
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:48,789
- You get many dates? I don't think so.
- No, I do. I actually do.

377
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,041
I never thought I was very pretty.

378
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:56,171
Oh, what is pretty anyway? I hate being
pretty. It's all so subjective anyway.

379
00:25:56,296 --> 00:25:59,967
The brightest men just drop dead
in front of a beautiful face.

380
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:04,179
When you climb into the sack,
if you're a bit giving, they're so grateful.

381
00:26:04,304 --> 00:26:06,140
Yeah, I know I am.

382
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,308
- D'you have kids?
- Yeah.

383
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:10,602
He's being raised by two women.

384
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:15,524
I think it works. They made some studies,
I read in a psychoanalytic quarterly.

385
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:18,110
You don't need a male.
Two mothers are fine.

386
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:21,905
<i>Really? Because I feel
very few people survive one mother.</i>

387
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:26,368
Listen, I gotta get my dog. Wanna wait?
I gotta walk it. Are you in rush?

388
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:30,664
- Oh, no, sure. What kind of dog you got?
- The worst.

389
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,168
It's a dachshund.
You know, it's a penis substitute for me.

390
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,963
Oh, I would have thought then
in your case a Great Dane.

391
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:59,735
- So, you serious with Yale or what?
- Serious?

392
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,364
Well, he's married.

393
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,743
Uh, I don't know. I guess
I should straighten my life out, huh?

394
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:10,079
Donny my analyst always tells me...

395
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:13,874
- You call your analyst Donny?
- Yeah. I call him Donny!

396
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,545
I call mine Dr Chomsky, you know.
He hits me with a ruler.

397
00:27:19,296 --> 00:27:21,340
Donny...? That's first name.

398
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:25,302
Donny says I get involved in situations
and that it's deliberate,

399
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:28,597
especially with my ex-husband Jeremiah.

400
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:30,557
I was his student and...

401
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:33,936
- Really? You married your teacher?
- Yeah, of course.

402
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:35,688
That's very...

403
00:27:35,813 --> 00:27:39,108
- He failed me and I fell in love with him.
- Oh, that's perfect.

404
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:42,194
I was sleeping with him
and he had the nerve to give me an F.

405
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,154
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

406
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,408
Not even an Incomplete, right?
Just a straight F?

407
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,576
You got a good sense of humour.

408
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:53,372
Hey, thanks! I don't need you
to tell me that, you know.

409
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:57,876
I've been making good money off it for
years, till I quit my job to write this book.

410
00:27:58,002 --> 00:28:01,380
Now I'm very, very nervous about it,
you know, but...

411
00:28:02,006 --> 00:28:04,466
D'you wanna...?
Oh, you don't have to pay.

412
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:07,803
- Oh, that's OK.
- I'm serious! Wanna walk by the river?

413
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:10,180
- You know the time?
- What do you mean?

414
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:13,350
If I don't get at least 16 hours,
I'm a basket case.

415
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:17,229
I'd like to hear about your book.
I really would. I'm quite a good editor.

416
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:18,981
Yeah?

417
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:22,401
Well, my book is about
decaying values. It's about...

418
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:27,323
<i>See, years ago I wrote a short story about
my mother called The Castrating Zionist</i>

419
00:28:27,448 --> 00:28:31,911
and I wanna expand it into a novel.
I could talk about my book all night.

420
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:46,592
Isn't it beautiful out?

421
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:50,387
Yeah, it's really so pretty
when the light starts to come up.

422
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:52,598
I know. I love it.

423
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:58,354
Boy, this is really a great city.
I don't care what anybody says.

424
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:00,940
It's really a knockout, you know.

425
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:10,282
I think I better head back. I've got an
appointment with Yale for lunch later on.

426
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,140
Mm, hi.

427
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,351
No, no. No, I'm awake.

428
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:41,814
Jesus, what are you...
What are you doing? It's 7.17 5.

429
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,650
Oh, yeah.

430
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,320
Really?

431
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:51,115
You did? At the museum?

432
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,827
Yeah, well, she's very active
in the feminist movement.

433
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:58,789
So you're gonna go
apartment hunting with Tracy?

434
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:04,169
Yeah, well, you should be able
to find something. It's Isaac.

435
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,298
Yeah, I don't think you'll have any trouble.

436
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:12,803
I knew you'd... see she's a terrific
woman, if you spent some time with her.

437
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:17,808
You still feel the same way about her?
Cos you hadn't mentioned it in a while.

438
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:21,228
So you... Yeah.

439
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,276
Yeah... right. I know.

440
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:29,695
She's great, I know. Great.

441
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:34,158
So... No, I gotta go apartment hunting
today. I have to get something cheaper.

442
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:37,036
I can't keep living where I do.
It's just...

443
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:45,002
- Isaac's terrific, isn't he?
- Yeah.

444
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:47,213
Said he had a great time with you.

445
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:51,175
Really? That's good cos I always think
he's uncomfortable around me.

446
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,344
Oh, come on.

447
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:58,432
- I missed you so much.
- Yale, this is ridiculous. You're married.

448
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,852
Listen to me. I'm beginning
to sound like one of those women.

449
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:04,021
It sounds terrible. I hate it.

450
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:09,860
- Why don't I just move out?
- No! I don't wanna break up a marriage.

451
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:14,323
Besides, I'm not looking for any
big involvement here. It's just... I don't...

452
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:18,619
It's crazy. It's crazy. I think about you
when you're not around.

453
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,123
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

454
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:26,919
I just guess I should be seeing
someone who's not married.

455
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,589
- You're so beautiful. You make me crazy.
- Oh, Yale, please stop it.

456
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:33,926
We're in Bloomingdale's
and someone's gonna see us.

457
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:36,971
Did I tell you I may have
an interview with Borges?

458
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:42,143
I told you that we met before. He seems
to feel very comfortable around me.

459
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:46,981
- Let's go somewhere and make love.
- Not now! Not now, Jesus.

460
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:51,235
Anyway, you've got a writing class in
an hour. Your students are gonna know.

461
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,447
You're gonna have
this big grin on your face.

462
00:31:55,573 --> 00:32:00,536
And I don't wanna go to your house cos I
can't stand the dog and the phone ringing.

463
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:04,915
Can't you hold me? Does your love for me
always have to express itself sexually?

464
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,837
What about other values like warmth
and spiritual contact? Hotel, right?

465
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,006
Jesus, I'm a pushover!

466
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:16,135
Oh, hi, Isaac.

467
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,263
- Hi. Is Willie ready?
- Yeah. Come on in.

468
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:21,432
He'll be right down.

469
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:24,435
- How you been, lke?
- Good. How you been?

470
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,604
- I've been terrific.
- Yeah?

471
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:30,566
Yeah. Been getting a lot of work done.
Things are going really well.

472
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:34,612
- Want some coffee or something?
- Uh, no. How's Willie doing?

473
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:38,449
Willie's fine. He's beginning
to show some real talent in drawing.

474
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:41,827
Where does he get that?
Cos you don't draw and I don't draw.

475
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:43,370
I draw.

476
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:46,874
Yeah, but there's no way that
you could be the actual father.

477
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:52,963
I'm hoping you'll take Willie on the 16th
cos Connie and I want to go to Barbados.

478
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:57,802
Are you still gonna write that stupid book?
I mean, are you serious about that?

479
00:32:57,927 --> 00:33:02,473
I'm very serious about it. It's an honest
book. You have nothing to be ashamed of.

480
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:05,476
- Excuse me.
- Can I talk to you a minute? Excuse me.

481
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:08,938
Here's what I still don't understand.
Where are you running?

482
00:33:09,063 --> 00:33:12,066
I can't understand
how you can prefer her to me.

483
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:14,026
- You can't understand?
- No.

484
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:15,986
You knew my history!

485
00:33:16,112 --> 00:33:20,616
I know. My analyst warned me, but you
were so beautiful I got another analyst.

486
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:24,745
- D'you think we can be ever just friends?
- You're putting in all the details?

487
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,998
No, not the part where
you tried to run her over with the car.

488
00:33:28,124 --> 00:33:30,584
Wha... I tried to run her over with a car?

489
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:34,213
What are you talking about?
It was late. You know I don't drive well.

490
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,424
It was raining. It was dark.

491
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:38,843
Why were you lurking outside the cabin?

492
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:43,431
I was spying on you guys cos I knew what
was happening. You were falling in love.

493
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:46,183
So you felt you had to
run her over with the car?

494
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:49,979
Do I look like that type of person?
You know how slowly I was going?

495
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:53,149
Not slowly enough
that you didn't rip the front porch off.

496
00:33:53,274 --> 00:33:57,903
Get the kid. I can't... I can't have
this argument every time I come over.

497
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:37,234
- You look funny in that jacket.
- I know.

498
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,613
I had hoped for something
in the gabardine.

499
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,990
- So, do you miss me?
- Yeah. Do you miss me?

500
00:34:43,157 --> 00:34:46,994
Of course I miss you. I love you. That's
why I come and get you all the time.

501
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:51,457
- Why can't we have frankfurters?
- Because this is a Russian tearoom.

502
00:34:51,582 --> 00:34:55,628
I mean, you wanna have a blintz or
something. Frankfurter gives you cancer.

503
00:34:55,753 --> 00:35:00,299
Besides, you see those two women here?
They have very beautiful women here.

504
00:35:00,424 --> 00:35:05,304
We could do well. I think we could have
picked up these two, if you were quicker.

505
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:07,473
I'm serious.

506
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:10,434
I think the brunette liked you.

507
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:16,732
I think I should, uh...
No, I'll call him.

508
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:30,121
Hello, Yale? I'm sorry for calling.

509
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:33,749
Well, no, no, nothing's wrong. I...

510
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:38,129
Well, I just thought that it's Sunday out

511
00:35:38,295 --> 00:35:43,592
and maybe if you could get away,
we could go for a walk or...

512
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:51,308
Oh, that's right. You mentioned that.
Well, OK, it was just a shot. Yeah. Yeah.

513
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:54,729
Well, I won't keep you. OK. Bye-bye.

514
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:02,528
Hello?

515
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,865
Oh, hi! Hi, how you doin'?

516
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:12,455
No, not at all. I was just sitting around
looking through the magazine section.

517
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:18,336
Uh, no, no, I didn't read the piece
on China's faceless masses.

518
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:20,963
I was checking out the lingerie ads.

519
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,175
Yeah, I can never get past them.
They're really erotic.

520
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,344
You wanna go for a walk?

521
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,600
I don't know, I've gotta get out. I'm going
stir-crazy and Yale's with Emily's parents.

522
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:35,102
It's such a beautiful Sunday.

523
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:40,483
It's an electrical storm.
You wanna wind up in an ashtray?

524
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,319
- It was such a beautiful day out.
- Yeah, wonderful.

525
00:36:43,444 --> 00:36:45,655
I think the Chrysler Building blew up.

526
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:49,867
- Oh, no! Thunder scares me.
- It's not my favourite sound either.

527
00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:54,538
D'you know every year one or two people
get killed during a storm in Central Park?

528
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:57,249
Why don't I run up ahead
and we'll talk later?

529
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:15,685
Jesus Christ, I'm soaking wet.
This is awful!

530
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,937
You look ridiculous! You know that?

531
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:21,649
Next time you want someone
to walk with you, get somebody else.

532
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:25,486
I've never seen anybody
react so strongly to a little bit of water.

533
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:28,281
It wasn't the water. It was the electricity.

534
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:31,826
I'll turn into a guy that sells
comics outside Bloomingdale's.

535
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:35,162
What do you think?
You think I look terrible? How do I look?

536
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:38,958
- I can't see.
- You should see your face!

537
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:42,586
You look kinda nice, actually.
You're sort of pretty.

538
00:37:43,337 --> 00:37:46,382
- I'm really annoyed with Yale.
- Why?

539
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:49,427
He was supposed to see me today
and then he couldn't.

540
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:53,598
And I had tickets to this Vivaldi concert.
He had to cancel on me, of course.

541
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:57,852
- That's what happens when...
- I know. You're having an affair.

542
00:37:57,977 --> 00:38:01,314
- What a terrible way to put it.
- Hey, I didn't put it that way.

543
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:05,276
My husband, well, my ex-husband,
had an affair when we were married.

544
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:08,154
- Really?
- Yeah. At least one that I know of.

545
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:12,533
And I never mentioned anything because
I felt that I was deficient in some way.

546
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:16,871
That I was bad in bed, not bright enough,
or physically unattractive.

547
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:20,917
- But in the end he was just a louse.
- Yeah, I know. An intellectual louse.

548
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:24,211
Oh, God, was he brilliant.
I was so crazy about him.

549
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:27,298
Really opened me up sexually.
Taught me everything.

550
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:29,467
Women found him devastating.

551
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:32,720
Oh, look. There's Saturn.

552
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:35,348
Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun.

553
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,601
How many of the satellites of Saturn
can you name?

554
00:38:38,726 --> 00:38:43,689
There's Mimas, Titan, Dione.
Hyperion, of course.

555
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:48,027
I can't name any of 'em and fortunately
they never come up in conversation.

556
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:50,821
Facts.
I got a million facts at my fingertips.

557
00:38:50,947 --> 00:38:55,660
They mean nothing cos nothing worth
knowing is understood with the mind.

558
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:59,080
Everything valuable enters
through a different opening,

559
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:01,749
if you'll forgive the disgusting imagery.

560
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:05,419
I don't agree at all. Where would we be
without rational thought?

561
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:08,839
You... you... you rely too much
on your brain.

562
00:39:09,006 --> 00:39:11,842
The brain is the most overrated organ.

563
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:15,555
I know. You probably think
I'm too cerebral.

564
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:18,975
Well, you are, you know,
kind of on the brainy side.

565
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:23,187
What's the difference what I think about
you? God knows what you think of me.

566
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:25,356
You're fine. Are you kidding?

567
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:29,402
You do have a tendency to get
a little hostile, but I find that attractive.

568
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:33,072
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm glad you do.

569
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:36,742
So, you think I have no feelings?
Is that it?

570
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:41,622
Hey, wha... You're so sensitive, Jesus!
I never said that.

571
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,043
I think you're... I think you're terrific.

572
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:51,257
Really, you know. I... I...
You're very insecure.

573
00:39:51,424 --> 00:39:54,093
I think you're wonderful, really.

574
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:58,639
What do you think?
It's probably stopped raining out.

575
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:01,601
You wanna grab a bite
or something like that?

576
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:07,523
I gotta see somebody this evening.
I don't know if it's a great idea.

577
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:10,651
Right. Well...
So what about sometime next week?

578
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:14,113
I might give you a call,
if you have any free time?

579
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:23,539
I'm... I'm not gonna have any free time
cos... I don't think it's such a great idea.

580
00:40:23,664 --> 00:40:29,337
I'm working on this book and it,
you know, takes a lot of my energy up.

581
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:31,339
OK. OK.

582
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:37,887
Your parents were in a good mood.
I almost had a good time.

583
00:40:38,012 --> 00:40:41,432
- Who did you call after dinner?
- Oh, uh, David Cohen.

584
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,519
He wants me to review the new book
on Virginia Woolf.

585
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:47,522
Written another one, if you can believe it.

586
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:51,442
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. What do you mean?

587
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:55,321
- You seem sort of nervous.
- No, I'm not. I feel good.

588
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:59,116
<i>- I was gonna ask you how you felt.
- No. I'm OK.</i>

589
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:03,704
- You seemed strange at dinner.
- Ah, just more thoughts about kids.

590
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,873
Oh, come on.

591
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:12,672
Listen, I told Cohen I'd stop by and
pick up the book. Is that OK with you?

592
00:41:12,797 --> 00:41:14,590
Yeah.

593
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:16,384
It's not too crowded.

594
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:20,096
No, not bad for Sunday.
I thought it'd be jammed.

595
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:25,685
Gee, I'm glad you could get out tonight
cos... I really did wanna see you a lot.

596
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:29,397
I like it when you get
an uncontrollable urge.

597
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,691
Yeah, I know, it's my best feature.

598
00:41:31,816 --> 00:41:35,945
My boyish impetuosity.
It's my... You look adorable.

599
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,114
So I have a chance to go to London,

600
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:40,992
study with the Academy
of Music and Dramatic Arts.

601
00:41:41,117 --> 00:41:45,580
- Really? When did this happen?
- The other day. Got a letter in the mail.

602
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:48,958
Well, that's great. That's terrific.

603
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:51,961
But I don't wanna go without you.

604
00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:54,380
Hey, I can't go to London and study.

605
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:58,176
Especially Shakespeare.
You know, I don't look good in leotards.

606
00:41:58,342 --> 00:42:02,346
- I'm serious.
- Of course you should go. It's great.

607
00:42:02,472 --> 00:42:04,098
You'll have a great time.

608
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:09,604
It's a great town and you're a wonderful
actress and it's a terrific place to study.

609
00:42:09,729 --> 00:42:13,316
You'll be the toast of the town.
You'll have a good time, really.

610
00:42:13,483 --> 00:42:17,236
- You shouldn't pass that...
- So what happens to us?

611
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:20,364
Well, you know, we'll always have Paris.

612
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,283
I'm kidding.

613
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:25,620
What kind of question is that?
You can't think of that now.

614
00:42:25,787 --> 00:42:28,706
You won't take me seriously
just because I'm 17.

615
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:33,044
Yeah, exactly, because you're 17.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

616
00:42:33,169 --> 00:42:35,713
You're 17 now. When you're 36, I'll be...

617
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:39,592
63.

618
00:42:39,717 --> 00:42:41,928
63, right. Thank you.

619
00:42:42,095 --> 00:42:46,015
You know, it's absurd. You'll be
at the height of your sexual powers.

620
00:42:46,182 --> 00:42:48,476
Of course, I will too probably, but,

621
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:50,728
you know, I'm a late starter.

622
00:42:50,853 --> 00:42:52,897
<i>- Who ordered the plain pie?
- Me.</i>

623
00:42:53,022 --> 00:42:56,025
So you must be anchovies,
sausage, mushrooms, peppers.

624
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,153
Forgot the coconut.

625
00:43:00,154 --> 00:43:05,368
So what do you wanna do tonight? We'll
go to the movies, I'll take you dancing...

626
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:07,787
- Anything?
- Absolutely anything.

627
00:43:07,954 --> 00:43:09,997
OK, I know what we can do.

628
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:14,419
- Well, get the filthy look off your face.
- Shut up. It's not filthy.

629
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:34,647
This is so corny. I can't believe this.
Is this what you wanted to do?

630
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:37,400
I don't think it's corny.
I think it's fun!

631
00:43:37,525 --> 00:43:40,236
It is fun, but I did this
when I was a kid, you know.

632
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:43,197
Well, I've never done it. I think it's great.

633
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:47,618
On my prom night I went
around this park five times, six times.

634
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:51,831
If I had been with a girl, this would
have been an incredible experience.

635
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:09,432
Quit fighting it.
You know you're crazy about me.

636
00:44:09,557 --> 00:44:13,061
I am. You're... You're God's answer to Job.

637
00:44:13,227 --> 00:44:16,147
You would have ended
all argument between them.

638
00:44:16,272 --> 00:44:21,319
He'd have said "I do a lot of terrible things
but I can also make one of these."

639
00:44:21,486 --> 00:44:24,155
And Job would've said "OK, you win."

640
00:44:34,874 --> 00:44:38,920
Look, this is crazy. I just can't do this
any more. It's really bullshit!

641
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:42,423
You're married and
I expected to see you this weekend

642
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:46,886
and I sit around like I've nothing to do,
so I called Isaac. We went for a walk.

643
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:50,640
- It was just lucky he was free.
- I know. I'm sorry.

644
00:44:50,765 --> 00:44:54,811
Oh, it's not your fault.
What the hell. It's a no-win situation.

645
00:44:54,936 --> 00:44:58,106
It's just I'm beautiful and I'm bright
and I deserve better!

646
00:44:58,231 --> 00:44:59,565
I know.

647
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:02,610
- What if I took some action?
- No!

648
00:45:02,777 --> 00:45:04,821
I'm not a home wrecker.

649
00:45:04,946 --> 00:45:08,366
I don't know how I got into this.
I guess we met at the wrong time.

650
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:10,576
It happens. Hello?

651
00:45:10,702 --> 00:45:13,538
Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Harvey. How are you?

652
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:15,748
What?

653
00:45:15,873 --> 00:45:21,087
Well... why don't you bring it by
on Thursday and I'll read it then, OK?

654
00:45:21,254 --> 00:45:26,592
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.
Right, I'll talk to you later. OK, bye-bye.

655
00:45:26,718 --> 00:45:29,971
- What d'you want me to do?
- Waffles. Nothing. It's just...

656
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:34,684
Waffles! Will you stop that now?
We're just going noplace. Excuse me.

657
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:39,689
Look, I know it's terrible. I'm at Sneedon's
Landing with Emily and her parents

658
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:43,443
and I love her!
And I'm thinking about you all the time.

659
00:45:43,568 --> 00:45:47,238
I don't wa... Christ. I don't wanna hear it.

660
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:50,575
I'm from Philadelphia.
My family's never had affairs.

661
00:45:50,742 --> 00:45:55,038
My parents have been married 43 years.
Nobody cheats at all. Hello?

662
00:45:55,204 --> 00:45:57,749
Oh, Donny. Hi! It's my analyst.

663
00:45:57,874 --> 00:45:59,917
Hello.

664
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:05,048
No...
Well, I think that'd be impossible.

665
00:46:05,173 --> 00:46:09,886
OK, well, probably later in the week.
OK, all right.

666
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:12,680
I'll get back to you. OK, bye.

667
00:46:12,805 --> 00:46:15,350
Oh, man. Waffles!

668
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:20,271
Please, just don't. This is really
a bad time... Waffles! ...a bad time for me.

669
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,650
I gotta think things through here.

670
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:29,155
- Obviously I shouldn't have come here.
- Well, no, probably not.

671
00:46:58,184 --> 00:47:00,395
Listen to that! How am I gonna...?

672
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,274
What is that sound? Can you hear that?
Listen. Where's it coming from?

673
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,777
It's like somebody's playing the trumpet.

674
00:47:07,902 --> 00:47:12,782
Or somebody sawing... Like a man
sawing a trumpet in half. Right? Right?

675
00:47:12,949 --> 00:47:15,076
- Let's fool around.
- You hear it?

676
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:17,161
It'll take your mind off it.

677
00:47:17,328 --> 00:47:20,999
How many times a night...? How often
can you make love in an evening?

678
00:47:21,124 --> 00:47:24,043
- Well, a lot.
- Yeah, I can tell. A lot. That's...

679
00:47:24,168 --> 00:47:27,255
Well, a lot is my favourite number.
Gee, really? Can you?

680
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:30,592
Let's do it some strange way
you've always wanted to do,

681
00:47:30,758 --> 00:47:32,802
but nobody would do with you.

682
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:36,431
I'm shocked. What kind of talk is that
from a kid your age?

683
00:47:36,598 --> 00:47:39,684
I'll get my scuba-diving equipment
and really show you...

684
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:42,812
- Take me seriously!
- I do take you seriously, but...

685
00:47:42,937 --> 00:47:46,441
Listen to this. Am I crazy? Wha...? Ah!

686
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:50,778
It's a rumbling. Listen to that goddamn...
Where the hell is that coming from?

687
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:56,367
- It's probably just the elevator shaft.
- It's not. It's coming from the walls.

688
00:47:56,492 --> 00:47:59,162
Let's... Let's... Can we check into a hotel?

689
00:47:59,287 --> 00:48:02,040
- Oh, you're crazy!
- I can't sleep here. I can't.

690
00:48:02,206 --> 00:48:04,500
Where's the aspirin? What d'you do...

691
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:07,587
I can help you fix this place up,
if you give me a chance.

692
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:10,131
No, and I don't want you living here.

693
00:48:10,298 --> 00:48:14,427
Tonight is a special occasion.
It's my first night in the apartment,

694
00:48:14,552 --> 00:48:18,306
so I wanted to break in the place
and I was afraid to sleep alone.

695
00:48:18,932 --> 00:48:21,434
Hey, what is this?
There's brown water!

696
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:24,854
- The pipes are rusty.
- What is this, Tracy?

697
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:28,483
- The pipes are rusty.
- Look at this. It's brown water.

698
00:48:28,608 --> 00:48:32,362
I'm paying $700 a month.
I got rats with bongos and a frog.

699
00:48:32,487 --> 00:48:34,530
And I got brown water here.

700
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:37,659
- Look. It's disgusting.
- What's gonna happen to us?

701
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:41,329
Listen. You keep ignoring me.
What's gonna happen with us?

702
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:45,166
What do you mean?
D'you have a good time with me?

703
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:49,212
- Aren't I a load of laughs and fun?
- Yes.

704
00:48:49,379 --> 00:48:51,756
So, and that's it, and we have fun.

705
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:55,134
Then you're gonna go to London
exactly as we discussed it.

706
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:59,847
You're gonna take advantage of that
opportunity and study acting over there.

707
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:04,018
And you'll think of me always
as a fond memory. It'll be nice.

708
00:49:04,185 --> 00:49:06,854
You know we have to
stop seeing each other?

709
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:09,482
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

710
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:13,361
I understand. I could tell by
the sound of your voice over the phone.

711
00:49:13,486 --> 00:49:18,032
<i>Very authoritative, you know.
Like the Pope or the computer in 2001.</i>

712
00:49:18,157 --> 00:49:20,994
It's not fair to you
and I don't know what I'm doing.

713
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,663
- Right.
- I mean... Come on, don't be angry.

714
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:27,417
You brought this up. You're not happy
the way things are going.

715
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:33,298
I'm not angry. It's just I knew it was gonna
end, but now it's happened I'm upset, OK?

716
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:35,925
Look, you don't wanna
make a commitment.

717
00:49:36,092 --> 00:49:40,555
And I don't wanna break up my marriage
and then find out we're no good together.

718
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,974
I've gotta start thinking about Emily.

719
00:49:43,141 --> 00:49:48,188
OK, you made your point very clear. I'm
just glad one of us had the nerve to end it.

720
00:49:49,147 --> 00:49:51,816
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah...

721
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:55,361
Of course I will. What d'you think
I'm gonna do? Hang myself?

722
00:49:55,486 --> 00:49:58,907
I'm a beautiful woman.
I'm young, highly intelligent.

723
00:49:59,073 --> 00:50:01,743
I got everything going for me. The point...

724
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:06,998
The point is that... I don't know,
I'm all fucked up. I'm just... Shit!

725
00:50:07,165 --> 00:50:11,794
What am I doing in this relationship
anyway? My phone never stops ringing.

726
00:50:11,961 --> 00:50:16,841
I could go to bed with the entire faculty
of MIT, if I wanted to. It's just...

727
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:20,637
I don't know. I'm wasting myself
on a married man, so I don't know.

728
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:26,267
Listen, I think I'd better go now.
I just want you to have this.

729
00:50:26,434 --> 00:50:31,147
- I got these tickets to see Rampal tonight.
- Oh, Mary. This is very hard on me, too.

730
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:33,858
Please! Just take them
and go with your wife.

731
00:50:34,025 --> 00:50:38,071
Mary, you love Rampal.
Call somebody up. Take Isaac.

732
00:50:38,196 --> 00:50:40,240
Fuck off, Yale!

733
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:46,579
I know you're gonna think the water's
a little brown, but you can drink it.

734
00:50:46,746 --> 00:50:48,790
Don't get thrown by this.

735
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:52,001
- I'm really sorry for bothering you.
- No problem.

736
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:57,257
- It's just... God, this is brown, isn't it?
- It is, but you get used to it after a while.

737
00:50:57,423 --> 00:50:59,217
I didn't know who to call.

738
00:50:59,384 --> 00:51:02,303
I don't think you should take Valium.
It causes cancer.

739
00:51:02,428 --> 00:51:06,015
- No. Half a Valium?
- Yeah, abdominal cancer, I think.

740
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:08,184
When did they find that out?

741
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:12,355
That's just my theory, but I think
it's correct. I got tissues someplace.

742
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,733
- Well, I guess I deserve everything I get.
- Come on.

743
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:19,904
It's true. It's really true. I mean,
I knew it couldn't possibly work out.

744
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:22,115
Yeah, you pick a married guy

745
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,910
and when it doesn't work out,
it confirms your worst feelings.

746
00:51:26,035 --> 00:51:28,079
What worst feelings?

747
00:51:28,204 --> 00:51:33,209
You know. Your feelings about men
and marriage and that nothing works.

748
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:36,963
Oh, please, don't psychoanalyse me.
I pay a doctor for that.

749
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:41,384
Hey. You call that guy
that you talk to a doctor?

750
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:47,182
You don't get suspicious when he calls
you at 3am and weeps into the telephone?

751
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:50,143
So he's unorthodox.
He's a highly qualified doctor.

752
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:54,606
He's done a great job on you. Your
self-esteem is like a notch below Kafka's.

753
00:51:54,772 --> 00:51:56,816
What is that noise?

754
00:51:56,983 --> 00:52:01,446
Yeah. Incredible, isn't it? There's a guy
upstairs. I don't know what the hell it is.

755
00:52:01,613 --> 00:52:05,658
It's like he's up there strangling a parrot
or something. I can't stand it.

756
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:09,996
- How can you stand it? It's terrible.
- I know. I used to have a great apartment.

757
00:52:10,121 --> 00:52:14,501
- Wanna go for a walk? It's quieter out.
- No, I think I'll just go home.

758
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:16,711
No, come on.

759
00:52:18,087 --> 00:52:22,217
He led me on! That's the point of it.
Why am I reluctant to criticise him?

760
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:25,261
Relax. Yale would not do that.
He's not that kind of a guy.

761
00:52:25,428 --> 00:52:28,681
Don't defend him.
You guys all stick up for each other.

762
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:34,479
Yale has his problems as we all do.
I'm starting to sound like Rabbi Blitzstein.

763
00:52:34,646 --> 00:52:38,775
Well, thanks for letting me come over.
I appreciate it. It's very nice of you.

764
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,237
Tracy and I are going out tonight,
if you wanna come along.

765
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:44,823
Oh, no, I'll be fine. I'll be OK.

766
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:46,574
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

767
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:51,162
- That's a healthy piece of towel paper.
- Oh, gee. God!

768
00:52:51,287 --> 00:52:53,331
Well, goodbye. Thanks a lot.

769
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:58,795
<i>But my point is a cab driver
doesn't make enough money... </i>

770
00:52:58,962 --> 00:53:03,758
Oh, look at that... that guy's toupee.
That's unbelievable.

771
00:53:03,925 --> 00:53:08,888
That is hilarious. There's a... a...
an inch of cheesecloth. You can see it.

772
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:12,559
I don't know why, you know,
his loved ones don't tell him.

773
00:53:12,725 --> 00:53:17,105
It's like the toupee dropped on his head
from a window ledge as he was walking.

774
00:53:17,272 --> 00:53:21,901
But look at his wife. Looks like her face
has been lifted about 8,000 times.

775
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:25,113
I know. It's so plastic. It's so tight.

776
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,699
I hate that. I just hate that. I wish...

777
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:31,703
Why can't they just age naturally
instead of putting all that junk on?

778
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,539
I know. Old faces are... are nice.

779
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:36,875
Yeah. They're great.

780
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:44,466
Hey, be careful. I think
I got black bean sauce in the bed.

781
00:53:44,632 --> 00:53:48,053
Oh, look. It's great.
The late show's a WC Fields film.

782
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:52,557
Oh, great. We gotta watch that.

783
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,103
Oh, God.

784
00:53:57,937 --> 00:54:01,441
Boy, I really feel good, you know.
I got my life together finally.

785
00:54:01,566 --> 00:54:02,942
Yeah?

786
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:08,198
You know, I just had to cut this thing off
finally. I'm not the type for affairs.

787
00:54:08,364 --> 00:54:13,161
- D'you ever hear from Mary, or see her?
- No. We just cut it off. It's easier that way.

788
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:16,956
She's terrific. She deserves more
than a fling with a married guy.

789
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:22,003
- Yeah, she's screwed up, but great.
- Right up your alley. You oughta call her.

790
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,506
- I... I should call her?
- Yeah.

791
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:27,175
- Why should I call her?
- Because she likes you.

792
00:54:27,342 --> 00:54:29,386
She told me she did.

793
00:54:29,511 --> 00:54:33,014
- You're crazy.
- No. She said she finds you attractive.

794
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:36,059
- She said she found me attractive?
- Yeah.

795
00:54:36,184 --> 00:54:39,604
- When was this?
- She said it when she first met you.

796
00:54:39,729 --> 00:54:42,399
- I didn't know. I can't.
- Sorry about that.

797
00:54:42,524 --> 00:54:45,443
I always think of you guys together.
I couldn't...

798
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:49,030
It's over. Unless you're serious
about Tracy. Are you?

799
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:52,325
- No. Tracy's too young.
- Then call her up.

800
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:57,414
Listen, she's an unhappy person.
I mean, she needs something in her life.

801
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,960
- I think you guys would be good together.
- I could be a good influence on her.

802
00:55:02,127 --> 00:55:07,173
I think that under my personal vibrations,
I could put her life in a kind of good order.

803
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:12,595
That's what you said about Jill, and she
went from bisexuality to homosexuality.

804
00:55:12,762 --> 00:55:15,932
Yeah, but I gave it
the old college try there for a while.

805
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:19,811
- Listen, you should call her up.
- No kidding. What did she say about me?

806
00:55:19,978 --> 00:55:23,648
She said that she likes you very much.
She thinks you're smart.

807
00:55:23,815 --> 00:55:26,359
- She thinks you're...
- Keep going. Don't stop.

808
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:28,945
- Attractive.
- Really? No kidding.

809
00:55:50,216 --> 00:55:53,553
You see, to me a great movie
is with WC Fields. That's what I like.

810
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,350
<i>Or Grand Illusion.  That's... I see that every
time it's on television, if I'm aware of it.</i>

811
00:55:58,475 --> 00:56:00,685
So what you got to eat here? Nothing.

812
00:56:00,852 --> 00:56:05,899
<i>Oh, Jesus, what is this? You got a corned
beef sandwich here from 1951, I think.</i>

813
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:08,902
- Look at this. I mean...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

814
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:12,530
- I don't have time to cook.
- Corned beef should not be blue.

815
00:56:12,697 --> 00:56:14,783
It's really terrible.

816
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:16,326
- Hey.
- What?

817
00:56:16,493 --> 00:56:18,119
Come here.

818
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:26,086
What're you doing?

819
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:30,215
What am I doing? You have to ask?
I was kissing you flush on the mouth.

820
00:56:30,382 --> 00:56:33,635
I... I cannot get my life
in any kind of order. It's just...

821
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,763
- It's something I wanted to do for ages.
- Yeah, I know.

822
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:41,393
Do you? Cos I... I thought I was hiding it.
I was trying to be real cool and casual.

823
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:44,145
I thought you wanted to kiss me
at the planetarium.

824
00:56:44,312 --> 00:56:46,356
- I did.
- I thought so.

825
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:51,987
But you were going out with Yale then and
I would never in a million years interfere...

826
00:56:52,112 --> 00:56:54,114
Did you want me to kiss you?

827
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:58,326
I don't know what I wanted.
I was so angry at Yale that day.

828
00:56:58,493 --> 00:57:01,746
But you were so sexy.
You were soaking wet from the rain

829
00:57:01,913 --> 00:57:05,709
and I had a mad impulse
to throw you down on the lunar surface

830
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:08,962
and commit
interstellar perversion with you.

831
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:13,717
I can't go from relationship to
relationship. It's senseless. I can't do it.

832
00:57:13,883 --> 00:57:17,304
Well, what... Are you still
hung up on Yale? Is that the problem?

833
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:19,472
I've got too many problems.

834
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:23,268
I'm really not the person
to get involved with. I'm trouble.

835
00:57:23,435 --> 00:57:27,897
- Hey, honey, Trouble is my middle name.
- What are you saying?

836
00:57:28,064 --> 00:57:30,567
Actually, my middle name is Mortimer.

837
00:57:30,734 --> 00:57:32,736
I'm... I'm kidding.

838
00:57:35,405 --> 00:57:38,783
My problem is I'm both attracted
and repelled by the male organ.

839
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:43,580
So it doesn't make for
good relationships with men.

840
00:57:43,747 --> 00:57:46,166
What about your relationships
with women?

841
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:49,419
You never really told me much
about your first wife.

842
00:57:49,544 --> 00:57:52,797
My first wife was
a kindergarten teacher, you know.

843
00:57:52,964 --> 00:57:56,468
She got into drugs
and she... moved to San Francisco.

844
00:57:56,635 --> 00:57:58,637
Went into est, became a Moonie.

845
00:57:58,803 --> 00:58:01,139
She's with
the William Morris Agency now.

846
00:58:01,306 --> 00:58:02,933
D'you like that?

847
00:58:03,058 --> 00:58:06,895
This... this, I think, has a kind of
wonderful otherness to it, you know.

848
00:58:07,062 --> 00:58:09,898
- A marvellous negative capability.
- OK.

849
00:58:10,023 --> 00:58:12,859
Kind of wonderful energy to it,
don't you think?

850
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,662
I thought that wine
was wonderful, didn't you think?

851
00:58:23,828 --> 00:58:26,831
And it just made my face
all flushed and hot.

852
00:58:26,998 --> 00:58:31,378
Yeah. You look so beautiful
I can hardly keep my eyes on the meter.

853
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:34,172
It's 14 bucks!

854
00:58:34,297 --> 00:58:37,384
I know, but it was a great restaurant.
Didn't you love it?

855
00:58:37,509 --> 00:58:41,972
Yeah, I love seafood. Course I'm drunk.
I don't know if you can tell or not.

856
00:58:42,097 --> 00:58:46,226
Hey, you know, it was the only time
in my life I ever had Chianti from Warsaw.

857
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:48,144
- Give me a kiss.
- OK.

858
00:58:57,696 --> 00:58:59,322
What are you thinking?

859
00:58:59,447 --> 00:59:02,701
I was thinking there must be
something wrong with me

860
00:59:02,868 --> 00:59:05,412
because I've never had a relationship

861
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:09,249
that's lasted longer than
the one between Hitler and Eva Braun.

862
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:11,543
I think you're still drunk!

863
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:53,501
It's great. It's... it's...

864
00:59:53,668 --> 00:59:58,590
I don't play the harmonica, but it's
an incredible... harmonica is what it is.

865
00:59:59,341 --> 01:00:04,095
<i>Well, you said you wanted to learn.
I'm trying to open up that side of you.</i>

866
01:00:04,262 --> 01:00:08,225
Tracy, you're throwing away
an enormous amount of real affection

867
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:10,393
on the wrong person.

868
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,562
It's not wrong for me.

869
01:00:16,441 --> 01:00:20,987
Listen, I don't... I don't think
we should keep seeing each other.

870
01:00:21,154 --> 01:00:23,156
Why not?

871
01:00:23,323 --> 01:00:26,952
Because I think you're getting
too hung up on me, you know?

872
01:00:27,118 --> 01:00:29,704
"Hung up on me."
I'm starting to sound like you.

873
01:00:29,871 --> 01:00:32,207
I'm not hung up on you.
I'm in love with you.

874
01:00:32,374 --> 01:00:34,876
You can't be in love with me.
We've been over this.

875
01:00:35,043 --> 01:00:38,755
You're a kid. You don't know what
love means. I don't know what it means.

876
01:00:38,922 --> 01:00:41,132
Nobody knows what the hell's going on.

877
01:00:41,299 --> 01:00:43,969
We have laughs together.
I care about you.

878
01:00:44,094 --> 01:00:46,930
Your concerns are my concerns.
We have great sex.

879
01:00:47,097 --> 01:00:49,099
You... But you're 17 years old.

880
01:00:49,307 --> 01:00:52,978
By the time you're 21,
you'll have a dozen relationships,

881
01:00:53,145 --> 01:00:55,897
believe me,
far more passionate than this one.

882
01:00:56,022 --> 01:00:58,316
Well, don't you love me?

883
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:03,989
The truth is that I love somebody else.

884
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,452
You do?

885
01:01:10,871 --> 01:01:13,165
Hey, come on... We... we...

886
01:01:13,331 --> 01:01:16,918
This was supposed to be
a temporary fling. You know that.

887
01:01:17,711 --> 01:01:19,880
You met someone?

888
01:01:20,046 --> 01:01:22,591
Don't stare at me with those big eyes.

889
01:01:22,757 --> 01:01:27,679
You look like one of those barefoot kids
from Bolivia who needs foster parents.

890
01:01:27,846 --> 01:01:29,848
Have you been seeing someone?

891
01:01:30,015 --> 01:01:32,476
No. Yes. Someone older.

892
01:01:32,642 --> 01:01:34,811
I mean, y-y-you know, y-y-you know.

893
01:01:34,978 --> 01:01:38,773
Not as old as I am,
but in the same general ballpark as me.

894
01:01:40,525 --> 01:01:42,527
Gee, now I don't feel so good.

895
01:01:43,403 --> 01:01:46,865
It's not right. You shouldn't get hung...

896
01:01:47,032 --> 01:01:49,201
I mean, you should open up your life.

897
01:01:49,367 --> 01:01:51,369
You know, you've got to.

898
01:01:51,536 --> 01:01:56,082
You state it like it's to my advantage,
when it's you that wants to get out of it.

899
01:01:56,249 --> 01:01:59,461
Hey, don't be so precocious, OK?
I mean, don't be so smart.

900
01:01:59,628 --> 01:02:03,924
I'm 42. My hair's falling out. I'm starting
to lose some hearing in my right ear.

901
01:02:04,049 --> 01:02:05,675
Is that what you want?

902
01:02:05,801 --> 01:02:10,097
I can't believe that you met somebody
that you like better than me.

903
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:14,893
Why should I feel guilty about this?

904
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,688
<i>I've always encouraged you
to go out with guys more your own age.</i>

905
01:02:18,855 --> 01:02:23,235
Kids from your class.
Billy and Biff and Scooter.

906
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,114
And, you know, little Tommy or Terry.

907
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,699
Hey, come on, don't cry.

908
01:02:32,077 --> 01:02:34,079
Don't cry.

909
01:02:34,246 --> 01:02:36,081
Come on, don't cry.

910
01:02:36,248 --> 01:02:40,544
Tracy... Tracy, don't...
Come on. Don't cry, Tracy.

911
01:02:41,378 --> 01:02:44,464
- Tracy...
- Just leave me alone.

912
01:02:47,926 --> 01:02:49,719
Tracy, come on, don't...

913
01:02:49,886 --> 01:02:51,888
Leave me alone.

914
01:03:49,404 --> 01:03:52,074
- That was wonderful.
- I'll say.

915
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:55,535
- I love being in the country.
- It's very relaxing.

916
01:03:55,702 --> 01:04:00,457
The mosquitoes have sucked all the blood
out of my left leg. Apart from that...

917
01:04:00,624 --> 01:04:04,086
- Doesn't it make you feel better?
- Yeah, you were dynamite,

918
01:04:04,252 --> 01:04:07,255
except I felt for about
two seconds you were faking.

919
01:04:07,422 --> 01:04:09,049
- Not a lot.
- No.

920
01:04:09,174 --> 01:04:12,719
Yes. When you dug your nails
into my neck, you were a little...

921
01:04:12,886 --> 01:04:15,180
Well, I guess I'm nervous around you.

922
01:04:15,347 --> 01:04:17,766
- Still?
- Well, yeah.

923
01:04:17,933 --> 01:04:21,019
- So crazy.
- Because I'd like everything to work out.

924
01:04:21,144 --> 01:04:25,065
It will. You should leave everything to me.
I'll make everything happen.

925
01:04:25,232 --> 01:04:27,234
D'you really promise?

926
01:04:27,401 --> 01:04:29,861
Because I like you.
I feel good around you.

927
01:04:30,028 --> 01:04:31,822
I don't blame you.

928
01:04:31,988 --> 01:04:36,702
Yeah, I mean... Yale was great, he was
absolutely great, but he was married.

929
01:04:36,868 --> 01:04:39,037
And Jeremiah, my ex-husband.

930
01:04:39,204 --> 01:04:42,249
He was just this oversexed,
brilliant kind of animal.

931
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:46,086
- Hey, what am I? Grandma Moses?
- Not at all. No, no, no.

932
01:04:46,253 --> 01:04:49,006
- You're much different.
- Yeah?

933
01:04:49,131 --> 01:04:52,592
Yes. You're someone
I could imagine having children with.

934
01:04:52,759 --> 01:04:53,927
- Really?
- Yeah.

935
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:56,346
Hit the lights. Go ahead. Turn 'em out.

936
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:58,515
We'll trade fours.

937
01:05:59,326 --> 01:06:01,495
Well, we never see you any more.

938
01:06:01,662 --> 01:06:04,081
Cos I'm working on my book.
I'm submerged.

939
01:06:04,247 --> 01:06:07,751
- It's that girl. Serious, isn't it?
- Well, serious, you know.

940
01:06:07,918 --> 01:06:11,630
When are we gonna get to meet her?
I'm sure Yale'd like to meet her.

941
01:06:11,797 --> 01:06:13,632
<i>We should go out sometime.</i>

942
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:17,135
I don't understand. Why does he
need a car? A sudden urge.

943
01:06:17,302 --> 01:06:19,096
He just wants it.

944
01:06:19,262 --> 01:06:23,308
What...? Is there nothing I can do
to dissuade you from this?

945
01:06:23,475 --> 01:06:28,480
It's so crazy. They should ban all cars
from Manhattan. I mean, this is crazy.

946
01:06:28,647 --> 01:06:32,317
Listen, Emily wants to know
why I never bring Mary around.

947
01:06:32,484 --> 01:06:34,486
Why not bring Mary around?

948
01:06:34,653 --> 01:06:37,739
- I don't know. Is it awkward for you?
- Are you kidding?

949
01:06:37,864 --> 01:06:40,450
I spoke to her. It's no problem for her.

950
01:06:40,617 --> 01:06:42,411
- Then why not?
- Well, you know.

951
01:06:42,577 --> 01:06:46,623
Hey, don't get this thing. I hate cars.
It screws up the environment.

952
01:06:46,748 --> 01:06:48,750
- This is a work of art.
- Yeah.

953
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:50,502
- Hi.
- Hi.

954
01:06:50,669 --> 01:06:54,715
- This is Emily.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

955
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:56,883
- This is Yale.
- Hi, Yale.

956
01:06:57,843 --> 01:06:59,636
So, shall we go?

957
01:07:01,471 --> 01:07:03,473
- Yeah, let's go.
- Sure.

958
01:07:48,435 --> 01:07:51,521
Look at that.
That building is almost torn down.

959
01:07:51,688 --> 01:07:54,274
Can't they have those things
declared landmarks?

960
01:07:54,441 --> 01:07:56,568
Yeah, I once tried to block demolition.

961
01:07:56,735 --> 01:08:00,989
Getting some people to lay in front of a
building, and a cop stepped on my hand.

962
01:08:01,156 --> 01:08:03,492
The city's really changing.

963
01:08:04,534 --> 01:08:08,830
I need something for round the house
that doesn't make me look too Mexican.

964
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:10,374
Ugh, this is...

965
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:13,752
- Mary?
- Oh, my God. Jeremiah. Well...

966
01:08:13,919 --> 01:08:14,878
Hi.

967
01:08:16,296 --> 01:08:20,342
- Jeremiah, this is my friend Isaac Davis.
- Hi. Glad to meet you.

968
01:08:20,467 --> 01:08:22,886
- God, this is incredible.
- Incredible.

969
01:08:23,053 --> 01:08:26,431
I'm in town for a few days.
There's a symposium on semantics.

970
01:08:26,598 --> 01:08:29,851
- Well...
- And you're looking so great. I just, uh...

971
01:08:30,018 --> 01:08:34,439
- You. You're so thin. You lost weight.
- Well, I have an exercise machine.

972
01:08:34,606 --> 01:08:37,150
Well, you really look good. Really good.

973
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:42,030
God. Well, I'm a bit late,
but it's just so nice seeing you.

974
01:08:42,197 --> 01:08:45,200
- It's great seeing you.
- I read an article by you

975
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:47,369
- On Brecht.
- Oh, shit! I know.

976
01:08:47,536 --> 01:08:50,455
I always was a sucker
for Germanic theatre.

977
01:08:50,622 --> 01:08:52,624
- Well...
- God.

978
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:56,712
- OK. Well, God... OK. So long.
- Bye. Bye, Jeremiah.

979
01:08:56,879 --> 01:08:58,881
Bye. Bye.

980
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,552
God, what a surprise.
I cannot get over it. My ex-husband.

981
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:06,930
And he really does look a lot thinner.
He looks great.

982
01:09:07,097 --> 01:09:11,226
You certainly fooled me. I was shocked
cos that's not what I expected.

983
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:15,814
- What did you expect?
- I don't know. You had always led me to...

984
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:19,443
You said he was a ladies' man,
that he opened you up sexually.

985
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:23,906
- So? So?
- Then this little homunculus, you know...

986
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:27,075
He's quite devastating.

987
01:09:27,242 --> 01:09:28,827
Really?

988
01:09:28,994 --> 01:09:32,539
Well, it's... it's amazing
how subjective all that stuff is.

989
01:09:32,706 --> 01:09:34,499
I don't know what you're...

990
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:39,796
- Boy, you're really typing away.
- Yeah, it's a cinch.

991
01:09:39,963 --> 01:09:41,965
You still reviewing Tolstoy?

992
01:09:42,132 --> 01:09:45,552
No, no, I finished that two days ago.
I'm on that novelisation.

993
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:49,473
What... what do you waste your time
with a novelisation for?

994
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,226
Why? Because it's easy and it pays well.

995
01:09:52,392 --> 01:09:56,980
It's like another contemporary American
phenomenon that's truly moronic.

996
01:09:57,147 --> 01:10:02,069
The novelisations of movies.
You're much too brilliant for that.

997
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:04,738
You should be doing other stuff.

998
01:10:05,656 --> 01:10:09,576
- Like what?
- Fiction. I've seen your fiction. It's terrific.

999
01:10:09,743 --> 01:10:11,119
Hello?

1000
01:10:11,286 --> 01:10:13,372
Mary, hi. It's Yale.

1001
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:15,916
I was hoping you'd pick up.

1002
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:18,168
Listen, could we meet for coffee?

1003
01:10:18,335 --> 01:10:20,587
Well, why? What is it?

1004
01:10:20,754 --> 01:10:25,133
Well, you know, I miss you.
I just thought maybe we could talk.

1005
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:29,888
No, I don't think that would be possible.
I don't think that would be possible at all.

1006
01:10:30,055 --> 01:10:33,517
I'm sorry, I just, uh...
No, I... I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1007
01:10:38,897 --> 01:10:41,108
- Who was that?
- What?

1008
01:10:41,275 --> 01:10:43,277
Who was that on the phone just now?

1009
01:10:43,443 --> 01:10:47,322
- Uh, dance lessons.
- Dance lessons that was?!

1010
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,993
Yeah. Do we want free dance lessons?

1011
01:10:52,077 --> 01:10:57,416
Right. They give you one free lesson,
then they hook you for $50,000 worth.

1012
01:11:04,798 --> 01:11:08,135
Viking loved my book.
They loved the first four chapters

1013
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:10,888
and, you know,
they were really complimentary.

1014
01:11:11,054 --> 01:11:13,807
Yale had read them
and thought they showed promise.

1015
01:11:13,974 --> 01:11:16,768
<i>But Yale's family,
so of course he's encouraging.</i>

1016
01:11:16,935 --> 01:11:19,146
But Viking will shell out the money.

1017
01:11:19,313 --> 01:11:24,443
Maybe it'll inspire Yale to finish his book.
He's been talking about it long enough.

1018
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:29,281
Mary read the stuff and she was
laughing out loud. I respect her judgment.

1019
01:11:29,448 --> 01:11:33,160
- Although she's doing a think piece on...
- Hello?

1020
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:36,747
Hey, where were you? You were
supposed to be home an hour ago.

1021
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:40,125
- Uh... I bought the car.
- Oh, no. You did?

1022
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:43,420
I know it's a meaningless extravagance,
but I had to have it.

1023
01:11:43,587 --> 01:11:45,589
- That thing we saw?
- Yeah.

1024
01:11:45,756 --> 01:11:49,259
Did you hear Viking Press loved
the first four chapters of lke's book?

1025
01:11:49,426 --> 01:11:51,428
- Great!
- They were real complimentary.

1026
01:11:51,595 --> 01:11:53,972
Next week I get the car
and we'll celebrate.

1027
01:11:54,139 --> 01:11:55,808
- OK.
- In our new car.

1028
01:12:48,819 --> 01:12:51,029
Jesus, listen to this.

1029
01:12:51,196 --> 01:12:55,159
"Making love to this
deeper, more masterful female

1030
01:12:55,325 --> 01:12:58,328
made me realise
what an empty experience,

1031
01:12:58,495 --> 01:13:01,790
what a bizarre charade
sex with my husband was."

1032
01:13:01,957 --> 01:13:04,918
Please. That is so nauseating. I...

1033
01:13:05,085 --> 01:13:08,130
Is this true? Did you make love
with Jill and a woman?

1034
01:13:08,255 --> 01:13:10,299
She put that in?

1035
01:13:10,424 --> 01:13:13,886
Christ! She wanted to, I think.
I didn't wanna be a bad sport.

1036
01:13:14,052 --> 01:13:16,722
- Did you have a good time?
- No, I didn't.

1037
01:13:16,847 --> 01:13:19,850
Did you hear the one
where he tried to run her lover over?

1038
01:13:19,975 --> 01:13:22,352
- Oh, yeah.
- Whose side are you on?

1039
01:13:22,519 --> 01:13:25,981
I didn't try and run her over.
It was raining. The car lurched.

1040
01:13:26,148 --> 01:13:30,235
Jesus, now everybody in town
is gonna know all these details.

1041
01:13:30,402 --> 01:13:32,738
Everybody... All my friends and...

1042
01:13:32,863 --> 01:13:37,117
Listen. "He was given to
fits of rage, Jewish, liberal paranoia,

1043
01:13:37,284 --> 01:13:40,120
male chauvinism,
self-righteous misanthropy,

1044
01:13:40,287 --> 01:13:42,456
and nihilistic moods of despair."

1045
01:13:42,581 --> 01:13:45,667
"He had complaints about life,
but never solutions."

1046
01:13:45,834 --> 01:13:49,463
"He longed to be an artist,
but balked at the necessary sacrifices."

1047
01:13:49,588 --> 01:13:52,841
"In his most private moments,
he spoke of his fear of death

1048
01:13:53,008 --> 01:13:57,679
which he elevated to tragic heights
when, in fact, it was mere narcissism."

1049
01:13:57,846 --> 01:14:01,433
- I came here to strangle you.
- Nothing I wrote was untrue.

1050
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,811
You make me out to be
Lee Harvey Oswald!

1051
01:14:03,977 --> 01:14:05,771
It's an honest account.

1052
01:14:05,896 --> 01:14:08,524
- That I'm narcissistic?
- You're self-obsessed.

1053
01:14:08,691 --> 01:14:12,695
- Misanthropic and self-righteous?
- I wrote some nice things about you.

1054
01:14:12,861 --> 01:14:14,655
Like what? What?

1055
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,907
<i>You cry when you see
Gone With The Wind. </i>

1056
01:14:17,991 --> 01:14:19,993
What are you laughing about?

1057
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,872
- You let her write that garbage?
- Wait. This is between you two.

1058
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:26,834
D'you honestly think
that I tried to run you over?

1059
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,254
You just happened to hit the gas
as I walked in front of the car.

1060
01:14:30,379 --> 01:14:33,590
- Did I do it on purpose?
- Well, what would Freud say?

1061
01:14:33,757 --> 01:14:37,011
That I really wanted to run her over.
That's why he was a genius.

1062
01:14:37,177 --> 01:14:39,680
Listen, I'm going upstairs.
I got work to do.

1063
01:14:39,805 --> 01:14:42,599
Don't forget that Willie's at ballet class.

1064
01:14:42,766 --> 01:14:44,810
Look, I better warn you.

1065
01:14:44,935 --> 01:14:48,439
I've had some interest in this book
for a movie sale.

1066
01:14:51,942 --> 01:14:53,819
Anybody home?

1067
01:14:53,944 --> 01:14:58,907
Yeah? I got an unbelievable story
to tell you. Absolutely incredible. You OK?

1068
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:00,659
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1069
01:15:00,784 --> 01:15:04,330
Just let me get one glass of brown water
cos I'm dying of thirst.

1070
01:15:04,496 --> 01:15:08,667
<i>- Isaac, I wanna talk to you first.
- Mm-mm. So I go over to Jill's today</i>

1071
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:12,838
because I'm real annoyed over that junk
she printed in the book. And...

1072
01:15:12,963 --> 01:15:16,884
Isaac, before you get wound up,
there's something I wanna tell you.

1073
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:20,179
- What's the matter? You look pale.
- Well...

1074
01:15:22,848 --> 01:15:25,100
Wh... What's the matter?

1075
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,772
Hey, what... Is there something wrong?
What is it?

1076
01:15:35,235 --> 01:15:37,696
I think I'm still in love with Yale.

1077
01:15:44,203 --> 01:15:46,246
What?

1078
01:15:47,414 --> 01:15:49,667
You... Are you kidd...?

1079
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:54,380
- You are?
- Yes.

1080
01:15:55,506 --> 01:15:58,175
Well, when did this happen? What...

1081
01:15:59,385 --> 01:16:01,637
<i>Well, you are or you think you are?</i>

1082
01:16:01,762 --> 01:16:04,264
I started seeing him again.

1083
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:06,433
When? Since when?

1084
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:12,189
Just since today. I mean,
that's why I wanted to be open about it.

1085
01:16:13,899 --> 01:16:16,944
Jesus, I'm... I'm shocked.

1086
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:21,699
I'm... I'm shocked. I'm surprised.

1087
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:25,160
I think I've always been in love with him.

1088
01:16:25,286 --> 01:16:27,413
How does he feel about this?

1089
01:16:27,538 --> 01:16:29,373
Well...

1090
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:34,044
He wants to move out of his place
so that we can live together.

1091
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:37,798
I'm stunned. I mean, I'm in a state of...

1092
01:16:37,923 --> 01:16:41,176
Somebody should
throw a blanket over me. You know, I'm...

1093
01:16:41,302 --> 01:16:45,222
Well, you see, he called me several times
in a very depressed state

1094
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:47,600
and he still loves me.

1095
01:16:47,725 --> 01:16:52,354
This is shaping up like a Noel Coward
play. Somebody should go make martinis.

1096
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:54,940
I don't blame you
for being furious with me.

1097
01:16:55,065 --> 01:16:57,109
I'm too stunned to be furious.

1098
01:16:57,234 --> 01:17:01,739
Well, then I wish you would. I wish you'd
get angry so that we could have it out.

1099
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:04,325
I don't get angry. I tend to internalise.

1100
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:08,829
I can't express anger. That's one of the
problems I have. I grow a tumour instead.

1101
01:17:08,954 --> 01:17:14,001
Well, I told you that I was trouble from the
beginning, from when we started dating.

1102
01:17:14,126 --> 01:17:16,420
So what does your analyst say?

1103
01:17:16,545 --> 01:17:19,798
Donny's in a coma.
He had a very bad acid experience.

1104
01:17:19,924 --> 01:17:23,469
Oh, that's gr... That's great.
I mean, you know...

1105
01:17:23,594 --> 01:17:26,889
- I think you're making a big mistake here.
- Why?

1106
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:30,392
Why? Because you... Why?
Because you're preferring Yale to me.

1107
01:17:30,517 --> 01:17:33,938
I know that sounds egotistical,
but... you know...

1108
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:37,691
This guy's been married 12 years.
What do you think will happen?

1109
01:17:37,816 --> 01:17:40,778
He'll be away from her for a month,
he'll go crazy.

1110
01:17:40,903 --> 01:17:44,907
And if he does commit to you, when
you start to feel secure, you'll drop him.

1111
01:17:45,032 --> 01:17:47,910
I know it.
I give the whole thing... four weeks.

1112
01:17:48,035 --> 01:17:50,704
I can't plan that far in advance.

1113
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:54,083
- You can't plan four weeks in advance?!
- No!

1114
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:56,835
What kind of foresight is that?

1115
01:17:56,961 --> 01:18:01,006
Jesus. You know, I knew you were crazy
when we started going out.

1116
01:18:01,131 --> 01:18:06,178
You always think that you're gonna be
the one that makes 'em act different, but...

1117
01:18:06,303 --> 01:18:08,931
Isaac, I'm sorry.
I really am. I'm really sorry.

1118
01:18:09,056 --> 01:18:11,308
Oh, well, I'm...

1119
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:14,186
I'm sorr... Where are you going?

1120
01:18:14,311 --> 01:18:16,355
- I gotta get some air.
- Oh.

1121
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:56,437
What are you doing here?

1122
01:18:56,562 --> 01:18:58,814
I spoke to Mary. Were you gonna tell me?

1123
01:18:58,939 --> 01:19:03,068
- I was, but... I'm trying to teach a class.
- So where can we go and talk?

1124
01:19:03,194 --> 01:19:06,280
- How'd you get past the security?
- I walked right past.

1125
01:19:06,405 --> 01:19:09,617
What are you telling me?
That you're gonna leave Emily

1126
01:19:09,742 --> 01:19:12,453
and run away with
the... the winner of the

1127
01:19:12,578 --> 01:19:15,247
Zelda Fitzgerald
Emotional Maturity Award?

1128
01:19:15,372 --> 01:19:17,208
Look, I love her.

1129
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:21,295
- What kind of crazy friend are you?
- A good friend. I introduced you two.

1130
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:24,298
- Why? What was the point?
- Cos I thought you liked her!

1131
01:19:24,423 --> 01:19:28,135
- I do! Now we both like her!
- Yeah, well, I liked her first.

1132
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:33,307
"I liked her first."
What are you, six years old? Jesus!

1133
01:19:33,432 --> 01:19:37,770
Look, would I have encouraged you
to take her out if I still liked her?

1134
01:19:37,895 --> 01:19:40,147
So you liked her? Now you don't like her?

1135
01:19:40,272 --> 01:19:43,734
It's early. You can change your mind
one more time before dinner.

1136
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:46,737
Don't get sarcastic about this.
You think I like this?

1137
01:19:46,862 --> 01:19:49,740
How long were you gonna see her
without telling me?

1138
01:19:49,865 --> 01:19:53,494
Don't turn this into
one of your big moral issues.

1139
01:19:53,619 --> 01:19:57,665
You could've said, but you... All you had
to do was call me and talk to me.

1140
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:01,502
I'm understanding. I'd have said no,
but you'd have felt honest.

1141
01:20:01,627 --> 01:20:05,256
I wanted to tell you about it.
I knew it would upset you. I...

1142
01:20:05,381 --> 01:20:07,633
We had a few innocent meetings.

1143
01:20:07,758 --> 01:20:12,721
A few? She said one. You guys should get
your story straight. Don't you rehearse?

1144
01:20:12,847 --> 01:20:14,974
We met twice for coffee.

1145
01:20:15,099 --> 01:20:17,142
Hey, she doesn't drink coffee.

1146
01:20:17,268 --> 01:20:21,564
Did you meet for Sanka? That's not too
romantic. A little on the geriatric side.

1147
01:20:21,689 --> 01:20:23,315
I'm not a saint, OK?

1148
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,110
You're too easy on yourself.
Don't you see?

1149
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:30,781
You're... You rationalise everything.
You're not honest with yourself.

1150
01:20:30,906 --> 01:20:35,411
You talk about you wanna write a book,
but in the end you'd rather buy a Porsche.

1151
01:20:35,536 --> 01:20:39,915
You cheat a little bit on Emily
and you play around the truth with me.

1152
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:44,378
The next thing you know you're in front
of a Senate committee naming names.

1153
01:20:44,503 --> 01:20:46,338
You are so self-righteous.

1154
01:20:46,463 --> 01:20:50,634
I mean, we're just people. We're just
human beings. You think you're God!

1155
01:20:50,759 --> 01:20:53,971
I gotta model myself after someone.

1156
01:20:54,096 --> 01:20:57,433
You just can't live the way you do.
It's all so perfect.

1157
01:20:57,558 --> 01:21:01,020
Jesus, what are future generations
gonna say about us? My God!

1158
01:21:01,145 --> 01:21:03,814
You know, someday
we're gonna be like him.

1159
01:21:03,939 --> 01:21:08,569
And he was probably one of the beautiful
people, dancing and playing tennis.

1160
01:21:08,694 --> 01:21:11,197
And now look. This is what happens to us.

1161
01:21:11,322 --> 01:21:15,034
You know, it's important
to have some kind of personal integrity.

1162
01:21:15,159 --> 01:21:17,661
I'll be hanging in a classroom one day

1163
01:21:17,787 --> 01:21:22,583
and I wanna make sure when I thin out
that I'm... well thought of.

1164
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:24,126
Ike!

1165
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:26,378
Isaac, where are you going?

1166
01:22:19,849 --> 01:22:22,518
No, I knew Yale had affairs.

1167
01:22:23,477 --> 01:22:25,604
But then, nothing's perfect.

1168
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:30,484
Marriage is a... requires
some minor compromises, I guess.

1169
01:22:30,609 --> 01:22:33,696
It's funny cos I'm just a non-compromiser.

1170
01:22:33,821 --> 01:22:36,699
I mean, I can't... I can't see that.

1171
01:22:36,824 --> 01:22:42,413
I think it's always a mistake to look the
other way cos you pay for it in the end.

1172
01:22:42,538 --> 01:22:45,875
But then you saw what Jill
wrote about me in that book.

1173
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,043
I'm living in the past.

1174
01:22:48,169 --> 01:22:50,296
How about you? You seeing anybody?

1175
01:22:50,421 --> 01:22:55,259
Yeah. You know, I... I never had any
problem meeting women. I mean, that's...

1176
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:58,471
But I was thinking about this
just about a week ago.

1177
01:22:58,596 --> 01:23:03,350
I think, and I know this sounds strange,
but I think I really missed a good bet

1178
01:23:03,476 --> 01:23:05,519
when I let Tracy go.

1179
01:23:05,644 --> 01:23:07,897
- Remember Tracy?
- Yeah. I liked her.

1180
01:23:08,022 --> 01:23:11,025
Yeah. I was thinking about this
at home last week

1181
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:14,904
and I think, of all the women
I've known over the last years,

1182
01:23:15,029 --> 01:23:19,825
when I actually am honest with myself,
I think I had the most relaxed times

1183
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:22,703
and, you know, the nicest times with her.

1184
01:23:22,828 --> 01:23:25,122
She was a terrific kid, but young, right?

1185
01:23:25,289 --> 01:23:27,333
So that's that.

1186
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,502
Why don't you call her?

1187
01:23:29,627 --> 01:23:32,546
No, I would never do that.
I think I blew that one.

1188
01:23:32,671 --> 01:23:36,092
I kept her at a distance
and I would never give her a chance.

1189
01:23:36,217 --> 01:23:40,137
And she was so sweet, you know.

1190
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:44,225
She called me. She left a message
with my service about a month ago

1191
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:50,231
<i>that I should watch Grand Illusion
on television and I never returned her call.</i>

1192
01:23:50,356 --> 01:23:53,442
Cos l, you know, I didn't wanna
lead her on or anything.

1193
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:55,820
She really cared about me and I...

1194
01:23:57,196 --> 01:23:59,490
You know I was a little pissed off at you.

1195
01:23:59,615 --> 01:24:01,033
Me?

1196
01:24:01,158 --> 01:24:05,955
I figured if you hadn't introduced Mary
to Yale, this might never have happened.

1197
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:14,422
An idea for a short story
about, um, people in Manhattan

1198
01:24:14,547 --> 01:24:17,216
who are constantly creating

1199
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:21,887
these real, unnecessary,
neurotic problems for themselves

1200
01:24:22,013 --> 01:24:27,935
cos it keeps them from dealing with
more unsolvable, terrifying problems

1201
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,438
about... the universe.

1202
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,317
Let's...
Well, it has to be optimistic.

1203
01:24:35,443 --> 01:24:39,321
Well, all right, why is life worth living?
That's a very good question.

1204
01:24:41,949 --> 01:24:46,287
Well, there are certain things, I guess,
that make it worthwhile.

1205
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,248
Like what?

1206
01:24:49,832 --> 01:24:54,628
OK... for me...

1207
01:24:55,546 --> 01:25:01,135
Ooh, I would say Groucho Marx,
to name one thing.

1208
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:05,056
And Willie Mays.

1209
01:25:05,181 --> 01:25:10,770
And... the second movement
of the Jupiter Symphony.

1210
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:17,276
<i>And... Louis Armstrong's
recording of Potato Head Blues. </i>

1211
01:25:19,445 --> 01:25:21,238
Swedish movies, naturally.

1212
01:25:21,364 --> 01:25:24,283
<i>Sentimental Education by Flaubert.</i>

1213
01:25:25,326 --> 01:25:27,495
Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra.

1214
01:25:29,121 --> 01:25:34,627
Those incredible
apples and pears by C?anne.

1215
01:25:36,295 --> 01:25:38,172
The crabs at Sam Wo's.

1216
01:25:40,925 --> 01:25:43,636
Tracy's face.

1217
01:29:26,192 --> 01:29:27,276
Hi.

1218
01:29:27,485 --> 01:29:29,320
Hi.

1219
01:29:30,321 --> 01:29:31,948
I...

1220
01:29:32,073 --> 01:29:34,116
What are you doing here?

1221
01:29:34,283 --> 01:29:36,953
Well, I ran.

1222
01:29:37,703 --> 01:29:41,040
I tried to call you on the phone,
but... it was busy

1223
01:29:41,165 --> 01:29:44,544
so I knew that was two hours' worth of...

1224
01:29:44,669 --> 01:29:47,129
So I couldn't get a taxi cab, so I ran.

1225
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,844
Where you going?

1226
01:29:52,969 --> 01:29:54,804
London.

1227
01:29:55,513 --> 01:29:57,557
You're going to London now?

1228
01:29:57,682 --> 01:30:02,186
What d'you... What d'you mean? If I got
over here two minutes later, you'd be...

1229
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:04,355
...you'd be going to London?

1230
01:30:09,652 --> 01:30:12,655
Well, let me get right to the point then.

1231
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,615
I don't think you oughta go.

1232
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:18,619
I think I made a big mistake.
and I would prefer it if you didn't go.

1233
01:30:18,744 --> 01:30:20,788
Oh, Isaac.

1234
01:30:20,913 --> 01:30:25,334
I mean it. I know it looks real bad now,
but, uh, you know, it...

1235
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:28,379
Are you seeing anybody?
Are you going with anybody?

1236
01:30:28,504 --> 01:30:29,922
No.

1237
01:30:31,048 --> 01:30:33,092
So... well...

1238
01:30:33,217 --> 01:30:37,138
D'you still love me,
or has that worn off or what?

1239
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:40,933
Jesus, you... pop up...

1240
01:30:41,893 --> 01:30:44,937
You don't call me
and then you suddenly appear.

1241
01:30:45,563 --> 01:30:49,233
I mean... What happened
to that woman you met?

1242
01:30:49,358 --> 01:30:53,070
Well, I'll tell you,
I don't see her any more.

1243
01:30:53,196 --> 01:30:56,908
I made a mistake.
What d'you want me to say?

1244
01:30:57,950 --> 01:31:00,411
I don't think you oughta go to London.

1245
01:31:03,122 --> 01:31:05,333
Well, I have to go.

1246
01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:08,294
I mean, all the plans have been made,
arrangements.

1247
01:31:08,419 --> 01:31:12,882
I mean, my parents are there now
looking for a place for me to live.

1248
01:31:14,842 --> 01:31:16,886
Well...

1249
01:31:17,011 --> 01:31:19,889
Do you still love me or what?

1250
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:23,434
Do you love me?

1251
01:31:23,976 --> 01:31:26,437
Well, yeah, that's what... Of course.

1252
01:31:26,562 --> 01:31:29,232
That's what this is all about, you know.

1253
01:31:29,357 --> 01:31:32,151
- Guess what? I turned 18 the other day.
- Did you?

1254
01:31:32,276 --> 01:31:34,487
I'm legal, but I'm still a kid.

1255
01:31:34,612 --> 01:31:37,615
You're not such a kid. 18 years old.

1256
01:31:37,782 --> 01:31:41,077
They could draft you.
In some countries you'd be...

1257
01:31:43,788 --> 01:31:47,083
- You look good.
- You really hurt me.

1258
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:49,293
It was not on purpose, you know.

1259
01:31:49,418 --> 01:31:52,713
I mean, I...
You know, it was... I mean...

1260
01:31:53,589 --> 01:31:56,551
It was just the way
I was looking at things then.

1261
01:31:56,676 --> 01:31:59,220
Well, I'll be back in six months.

1262
01:31:59,345 --> 01:32:01,806
Six months! Are you kidding?

1263
01:32:02,515 --> 01:32:04,767
Six months you're gonna go for?

1264
01:32:05,977 --> 01:32:11,399
We've gone this long. I mean, what's
six months if we still love each other?

1265
01:32:11,524 --> 01:32:13,568
Hey, don't be so mature, OK?

1266
01:32:13,693 --> 01:32:16,362
I mean, six months is a long time.
Six months!

1267
01:32:16,487 --> 01:32:22,201
You're gonna be in the thea... working
in the theatre with actors and directors.

1268
01:32:22,326 --> 01:32:26,164
You know, you go to rehearsal
and you hang out with those people.

1269
01:32:26,289 --> 01:32:31,878
You have lunch a lot and before you know
it attachments form and... you know...

1270
01:32:32,003 --> 01:32:35,715
I mean, you don't wanna get into that...
You'll change.

1271
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,926
In six months you'll be
a completely different person.

1272
01:32:39,051 --> 01:32:42,305
Well, don't you want me
to have that experience?

1273
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:45,641
I mean, a while ago
you made such a convincing case.

1274
01:32:47,727 --> 01:32:51,022
Yeah, of course I do, but, you know...

1275
01:32:51,147 --> 01:32:55,485
I mean, I just don't want that thing
about you that I like to change.

1276
01:32:59,906 --> 01:33:02,075
I've gotta make a plane.

1277
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,161
Come on, you don't... Come on.

1278
01:33:05,286 --> 01:33:07,663
You don't... You don't have to go.

1279
01:33:08,706 --> 01:33:12,001
Why couldn't you have
brought this up last week?

1280
01:33:14,712 --> 01:33:17,090
Six months isn't so long.

1281
01:33:18,883 --> 01:33:21,344
Not everybody gets corrupted.

1282
01:33:23,471 --> 01:33:26,933
You have to have a little faith in people.
