<i>I got a great song that the paesans

3
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,449

20
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:52,445
We got to do Miami jokes. If you're
in Florida, you do Miami jokes.

21
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:55,582
Morty, I tried Miami jokes.
I don't know what works any more.

22
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,829
- Why? What happened?
- I got that big Miami joke that I do.

23
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:02,296
About the hotels being expensive
and how much it costs...

24
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:06,504
like $150 a day for a sleeping room,
and I said to the clerk "What's cheaper?"

25
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:09,424
He said "I got a room for $10,
but you make your own bed."

26
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:12,130
So he gave me a hammer and
some nails. That's the joke.

27
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:16,182
- It's a good joke. It works.
- Been workin' for years. Last night it died.

28
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:17,309
Really?

29
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,274
That audience sat there like
they were an oil painting.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,559
I don't know why. Always
works when I do it.

31
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:26,146
You do that joke? Maybe
that's where I got it from.

32
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,772
When I broke into this
business in New York...

33
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:32,408
I could play at least 12 to 20 weeks
a year without leaving the city.

34
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:35,373
- There was the Latin Quarter...
- The China Doll.

35
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,622
- China Doll...
- Queen's Terrace.

36
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:42,164
- Played the Boulevard...
- What about Jersey? The Stagecoach...

37
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:44,871
- Lamplighters.
- Riviera, Bill Miller's.

38
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:49,635
Look how far you have to go. You went
to Washington. I went to Baltimore.

39
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:53,808
- You gotta have good tyres to work today.
- Or a good car.

40
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:56,804
The first impression I did,
I went to see <i>The Seventh Veil.</i>

41
00:02:56,937 --> 00:03:01,765
I didn't want to become an impressionist.
I was trying to develop an English accent.

42
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,361
The idea of impersonating James Mason
was the furthest thing from my mind.

43
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:09,904
Out came this impression and I've
been doing impressions ever since.

44
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:14,826
- But this thing is all in the mask, right?
- And then I did Picasso for a few weeks.

45
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,078
You know the first time
I saw you do Mason?

46
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:20,659
It was backstage at the
Sullivan show. You were brilliant.

47
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:23,285
I was there with Danny Rose.
Remember Danny Rose?

48
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:26,791
He was handling an actor... the manager...
and a one-legged tap-dancer.

49
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:31,421
It was his normal handling. Danny
Rose. Yeah. Oh, he's the best.

50
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:36,549
May I say one word? Might I just
interject one concept at this juncture?

51
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:39,472
You're lookin' for somebody
for Memorial Day weekend.

52
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:43,649
My blind xylophone player, OK?
The man would be perfect for your room.

53
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:47,987
- Ah, forget it.
- Philly, will you please hear me out?

54
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:51,980
The man is a beautiful man.
He's a fantastic individual.

55
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:54,869
My hotel gets old Jewish
people. They're blind.

56
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:58,494
- They ain't gonna pay to see a blind guy.
- So forget that, then.

57
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:01,909
How about Herbie Jayson's birds?
Herbie Jayson's birds.

58
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:06,540
They're little birds. They peck tunes
out on a piano. It's a beautiful thing.

59
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:10,422
What about my one-legged tap-dancer?
Take him for a weekend.

60
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:14,550
- All right, my one-armed juggler.
- Not for my hotel!

61
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:18,465
All right, what about Lou Canova,
my Italian singer? He'd be great.

62
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:23,145
Lou Canova's a dumb, fat, temperamental
has-been with a drinking problem.

63
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:27,816
Jesus! What about Eddie Clark's penguin?
Eddie Clark and his penguin.

64
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:32,488
The penguin skates on the stage dressed
as a rabbi. It's hilarious. He's got a beard.

65
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:35,985
I'll tell you what, give me Sonny Chase.
He's the best act you got.

66
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:39,073
- He's fast, he's funny.
- I don't handle Sonny any more.

67
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,245
Since when?

68
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:46,333
It's a long story. I discovered the kid.
He slept on my sofa. I supported him.

69
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,710
I don't wanna bad-mouth the kid, but
he's a horrible, dishonest, immoral louse.

70
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:54,093
- And I say that with all due respect.
- I know, Danny.

71
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:58,764
- They get a little success and leave you.
- That's my point! Believe me, Philly...

72
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:03,056
if I had all the acts in this business that
I started that made it, I'd be a rich man.

73
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:07,934
I'd like to help, but Weinstein's Majestic
Bungalow Colony is a classy place.

74
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:10,641
- I need a classy act.
- I wanna show you this lady.

75
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:14,148
She is the Jascha Heifetz of this
instrument. She is something.

76
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:16,608
You gotta see this, Philly.
It's incredible.

77
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:24,622
Never took a lesson.
This is self-taught.

78
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:28,334
Next year, Philly, my hand to God,
she's gonna be at Carnegie Hall.

79
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,915
But you, I'll let you have her
now at the old price, OK?

80
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,254
Which is anything you wanna
give me, anything at all.

81
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:40,473
- I remember that woman.
- You have never seen acts like this.

82
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,436
This guy would work his
tail off for these acts.

83
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:46,646
If he believed in an act,
he would go all out.

84
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:50,435
Danny, my partner wants me to
open up with the dachshund...

85
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,068
but I think I should open up
with the swan or the giraffe.

86
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:59,702
The swan is pretty and it fascinates the
people. Or... have an animal of this type.

87
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:05,912
I think your partner's right. Open up with
the dachshund and build to the giraffe.

88
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:08,534
Close with the giraffe cos
it's got more impact.

89
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,452
Really?

90
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:14,499
If you take my advice, you'll be one of the
great balloon-folding acts of all time.

91
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:17,968
Cos I don't see you just folding
these balloons in joints.

92
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:21,797
You listen to me, you're gonna fold
these balloons at universities.

93
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:25,931
You're gonna make your snail
and your elephant on Broadway.

94
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:29,099
But the thing to remember is
before you go out on stage...

95
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:32,602
you gotta look in the mirror and
you gotta say your three S's:

96
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:35,441
Star, smile, strong.

97
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:38,573
Star, smile, strong.

98
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:41,822
- Danny used to be a performer.
- He was a comic.

99
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:45,619
He worked the Catskills. He did all the
old jokes and stole from everybody.

100
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:48,121
He was the kind of comic
you'd think he'd be.

101
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:52,664
God bless you, darling. Let me ask you a
question, sweetheart. How old are you?

102
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:55,467
- 81.
- 81 years old. Isn't that fantastic?

103
00:06:55,592 --> 00:07:00,301
No, really. She's 81.
It's fantastic. I mean that.

104
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,799
Unbelievable. You don't look
a day over 80. No, I mean it.

105
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:06,686
I'm just kiddin'. I love you.
You're really beautiful.

106
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:09,018
What sign are you, darling?

107
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:11,721
- What?
- She says "What?" She's great.

108
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:14,231
But I drove up here today.
I love driving.

109
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:18,026
You run across so many interesting
people. I saw a terrible accident.

110
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:22,653
Two taxi cabs collided.
30 Scotchmen were killed.

111
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:28,283
He stopped doing his act because he
was working the Catskill Mountains.

112
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:31,204
Nobody in the audience
is under 80 years old.

113
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:34,456
He's on stage, doing his act,
two people get heart attacks.

114
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,163
So naturally he became
a personal manager.

115
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:40,420
You can't do a good act, you
become a personal manager.

116
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:43,175
But his acts were so devoted.
They loved him.

117
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:46,758
Where you gonna find that
kind of devotion today?

118
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:51,888
The funniest Danny Rose story is the time
he's handling a hypnotist. A hypnotist.

119
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:55,227
He's got the guy working
the Catskill Mountains.

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,646
The hypnotist brings up this
Jewish lady and hypnotises her.

121
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,903
Tessie! Tessie!

122
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:05,742
- The body is warm. It's a good sign.
- Yes, that's a good sign.

123
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:06,950
Tessie! Tessie!

124
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,496
I promise you, if your wife
never wakes up again...

125
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:14,706
I will take you to any
restaurant of your choice, OK?

126
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:16,878
Do you like Chinese food?

127
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:26,848
All right, you finished? Excuse me.
Hold it, hold it. Are you finished?

128
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:34,437
Are you finished? Because I have
the greatest Danny Rose story.

129
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:36,606
Hold it now. Are you finished?

130
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:40,685
I have the greatest Danny
Rose story, all right?

131
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:43,396
You wanna do anything?
This is gonna take some time.

132
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:46,071
- Can I call home?
- Go ahead.

133
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:47,946
- Coffee.
- Are you ready?

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,409
We're gonna be here a while. This
is the greatest Danny Rose story.

135
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:57,086
- This is the one with Lou Canova.
- The tall guy, the singer? The Italian kid?

136
00:08:57,214 --> 00:08:59,919
He was the kid that had
those semi-hit records?

137
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,629
He had a record, I think, called "Agita".
It was on the charts for about 15 minutes.

138
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:09,224
This is not during those 15 minutes.
This is 25 years later.

139
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:13,301
And Lou cannot get anybody to
handle him. The man's in trouble.

140
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:16,854
And the only one who believes
in him is Danny Rose.

141
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:20,103
And by now, you gotta remember,
Lou is a has-been...

142
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:24,650
he's got a big ego, a temperament
and a slight drinking problem...

143
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:27,950
and Danny has faith.

144
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,201
<i>♪ I like the looks of you</i>

<i>♪ I do, yeah</i>

161
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:37,721
A third show? I thought
there was only two.

162
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:40,857
There's three on weekdays and
there's four on weekends.

163
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:43,356
Four?! Tell 'em I'll walk!
Four shows!

164
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:47,152
What do you mean? You can't. Lou,
we're not in a position yet to walk.

165
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:50,283
- And I use the word "yet".
- My hair's all screwed up.

166
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,447
Your hair is fine.
Did you do the three S's?

167
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,123
Yeah. Strong, smile, star. I know.
Every time, you tell me every time.

168
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:00,458
You should do
"My Funny Valentine"...

169
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:03,374
after great crooners from
the past who are deceased.

170
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:07,718
- Hi, Lou. I wanted to meet you.
- But I'm discouraged. I'm down.

171
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,884
Please. God bless you, darling.

172
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:12,469
Why are you discouraged?
You're magnificent.

173
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,639
I can't pay my alimony.

174
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:17,769
I'll waive my commissions till
we get rolling, that's all.

175
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:21,561
- How you gonna live? You gotta eat.
- Don't worry about me so much.

176
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:25,641
I got other acts. I think about you in
the long run, that's what I'm saying.

177
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:30,240
You're the kinda guy that will always
make a beautiful dollar in this business.

178
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:34,199
You're what I call a perennial. You
get better-looking as you get older.

179
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:38,707
That's true. When I'm singin', I can feel
the women mentally undressing me.

180
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,328
It's true.

181
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,996
<i>OK, so Danny is everything to Lou. He
picks his songs, his arrangements.</i>

182
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:50,545
<i>He picks his shirts, his clothes. He
eats with him. They're inseparable.</i>

183
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,048
<i>Danny is his manager, his
friend, his father-confessor.</i>

184
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:57,053
I wanna go across the street
and get one white rose.

185
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:59,937
You wanna get a white rose?
Why do you want a white rose?

186
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:03,682
- I met this chick.
- Oh, Lou. Don't tell me about it...

187
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:06,604
because you're gonna get
caught in a hotel room...

188
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:09,192
you're gonna wind up
paying three alimonies.

189
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:12,573
- No, no, no. This is a classy chick.
- I can imagine.

190
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,568
- She's one of these decorators.
- With all due respect, you got a wife.

191
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:19,825
- This is different. I'm in love.
- Oh, great.

192
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:24,208
The usual single white
rose for Tina Vitale.

193
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:27,789
And just the words
"I love you, my bambina."

194
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:32,136
Come here a minute. Lou, come here.
Just step into my office for a minute.

195
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:35,512
The usual single white rose?
How long has this been going on?

196
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:39,389
- For a while. I can keep a secret.
- You're keeping a secret from me?

197
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,971
I knew you'd get miffed about it,
you'd get bugged because of my wife.

198
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:46,024
But, Danny, Tina, she's beautiful.

199
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:48,856
- She's like a Madonna.
- I believe you.

200
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:51,276
- She knows you're married?
- I levelled with her.

201
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:53,482
So what kinda woman is she?

202
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:58,113
I tried to introduce you to her for a long
time, but I knew you wouldn't have it.

203
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,951
I've always tried to
teach you, Lou...

204
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:05,032
that sooner or later you're gonna have
to square yourself with the big guy.

205
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,621
Is that true? You're gonna
pay your dues someday.

206
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:12,671
You're a married man. Take my aunt
Rose, not a beautiful woman at all.

207
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:15,720
She looked like something you
buy in a live-bait store.

208
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:21,186
She had wisdom. She used to say "You
can't ride two horses with one behind."

209
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,981
So you see what I'm sayin'?
That's my point.

210
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,770
<i>OK, now a little time passes.</i>

211
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,524
<i>Danny's still struggling with the various
bird acts and the blind xylophone player.</i>

212
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:36,819
<i>Suddenly the nostalgia craze
is starting to build.</i>

213
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:40,570
<i>And Danny finds he can
book Lou a little easier.</i>

214
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:43,197
<i>♪ You may be king</i>

215
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,955
<i>♪ You may possess the world</i>

216
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,292
<i>♪ And all of its gold</i>

217
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:52,122
<i>♪ Oh, but gold won't
bring you happiness</i>

218
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:55,922
<i>♪ When you're growing old</i>

219
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:58,296
<i>♪ Oh, the world,
it's still the same...</i>

220
00:13:58,432 --> 00:14:01,966
<i>He's working these nostalgia cruises
and the audience is eating it up.</i>

221
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:07,393
<i>Suddenly an over-the-hill boy singer
is starting to get some attention.</i>

222
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:10,727
<i>♪ They shine high above...</i>

223
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:17,983
<i>And I am very honoured to announce that
one of America's great singing legends...</i>

224
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:22,068
<i>a cherished musical legend, is
making part of his comeback...</i>

225
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:24,957
<i>on the Joe Franklin TV Show.</i>

226
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,832
<i>I hope my enthusiasm is
generating, cos I love this man.</i>

227
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:32,082
<i>I mean, if you can love a
man, I love Lou Canova. Lou.</i>

228
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:35,631
- <i>Thank you, Joe. You're very kind.</i>
- <i>I mean that. Are you sort of...</i>

229
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:39,379
<i>I've been on the show three,
four times and it just helps.</i>

230
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:43,215
<i>I mean, it helps everybody.
You're New York. What can I tell ya?</i>

231
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:49,224
<i>I always had the feeling that you were
never obsessed to be a superstar.</i>

232
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:51,683
<i>You were never driven
to be a superstar.</i>

233
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:54,523
<i>You just let it drift and
take its own course.</i>

234
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:58,403
<i>When I had a record out in the '50s,
it made some noise and everything...</i>

235
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:03,741
<i>and you start to get to feel as though
maybe you wanna be a bigger star.</i>

236
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:09,163
<i>It didn't really bother me. But now I'm
doin' cruise ships, I'm doin' bigger shows.</i>

237
00:15:09,294 --> 00:15:12,877
<i>I feel great. It's a good
time in life to do it.</i>

238
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:19,219
<i>OK. Now, two days later, Danny runs
into Milton Berle on Broadway.</i>

239
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:22,797
<i>Milton is doing an NBC
special, a nostalgia show.</i>

240
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:28,354
<i>Plus he needs a singing act to
open for him at Caesar's Palace.</i>

241
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,015
<i>Danny convinces him to come and see
Lou on a club date at the Waldorf.</i>

242
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,311
<i>And if Milton likes Lou, he
gets the TV shot and Caesar's.</i>

243
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:40,781
I mean, I love Milton.
He's a beautiful man.

244
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:44,361
- This is two years out of our guts.
- Don't be so nervous, Lou.

245
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:49,075
You gotta take him out Sunday and let
him relax. He's gonna be all wound up.

246
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:53,041
I'll open with "Volare" or
"You Make Me Feel So Young".

247
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:54,714
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

248
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,299
- How old are you?
- 12.

249
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:59,342
- Are you married?
- No.

250
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:00,750
Fantastic fettucine.

251
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:04,837
Do "My Funny Valentine" with the
special lyrics about the moon landing.

252
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:07,727
Maybe we oughta put on a
press agent for that week.

253
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:10,770
I've been gettin' your name
in the columns pretty good.

254
00:16:10,898 --> 00:16:14,101
It's not like havin' a steady
press agent. You know, steady.

255
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:17,188
Take him to a movie or he's
gonna be a wreck by showtime.

256
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:22,481
Great idea for a TV show. Mr Televisión
looks at the stars of the '50s.

257
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:24,326
Beautiful!

258
00:16:24,828 --> 00:16:28,778
<i>That week Danny devotes
to Lou exclusively.</i>

259
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,166
<i>They go over the running
order of his act 15 times...</i>

260
00:16:32,294 --> 00:16:36,126
<i>what colour shirts to wear, his weight...
he wants Lou to lose some pounds.</i>

261
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,961
<i>I don't know who's more
nervous, Lou or Danny.</i>

262
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:44,134
<i>Meanwhile, his other clients are starting
to complain about their own problems.</i>

263
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:47,799
I couldn't get your service. I had a crisis.
A cat ate one of my birds.

264
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:50,223
I cancelled the show and
Ralph doesn't wanna pay.

265
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:53,058
What do you mean,
you don't wanna pay?

266
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,523
A cat ate his bird. That comes
under the act-of-God clause.

267
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:59,569
- He gets paid if he does his show only.
- It was a lead bird.

268
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:02,401
Remember Pee Wee, used to
peck "September Song"?

269
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:05,736
Pee Wee's gone? Pee...
Ralph, what are you doin'?

270
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:10,864
Pee Wee has now been eaten by a feline.
Pee Wee gave us many a laugh and tear.

271
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,325
Danny, I don't pay no
birds that don't work.

272
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,627
- Where were you when I needed you?
- Yeah, where were you?

273
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:19,673
I admit, it's my fault.
I've been remiss lately.

274
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,632
I've been very busy with another client.
After Sunday night you'll have me.

275
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:26,467
I'll be yours exclusively.
I know how you feel.

276
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:29,718
Pee Wee was the son he never
had, so it's, you know...

277
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:33,267
I promise, after Sunday
night, really, I'm with you.

278
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:36,480
One, two.

279
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:39,858
I want you to open with "You're
Nobody Till Somebody Loves You".

280
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:42,478
And then go into "My Bambina"...

281
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:46,315
and after that do great crooners
from the past who are now deceased.

282
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:49,820
- And then "Agita" if you want.
- Would you do me a favour tomorrow?

283
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:52,742
- You name it, you got it.
- I want you to bring Tina.

284
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:55,116
- Who's Tina?
- I told you about Tina.

285
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:58,952
- I'm really crazy about her.
- I thought I talked you outta that.

286
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:03,502
It's no use. I'm like a little kid. I'm still
sendin' her a white rose every day.

287
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:05,675
Don't we have enough on our mind?

288
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:10,016
She's been lucky for me from the first day
I met her. Good things started happenin'.

289
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:13,974
Yeah, but Teresa's gonna be there.
You're gonna get in a lot of trouble.

290
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:16,595
That's why you gotta bring her.
You be the beard.

291
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:19,223
What? I don't wanna be a beard.

292
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,230
Come on. I'm tellin' ya, I'll
do a great job if she's there.

293
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:25,612
- Without her I'm gonna be lost.
- Since when? This is business.

294
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,780
Why are you makin' such a big deal?

295
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,483
Terry goes home, then I'll
take her off your hands.

296
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:32,946
When there's people
around, she's with you.

297
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:36,248
No, it's not nice. You're gonna
wind up in alimony jail.

298
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,330
- I can't function without her. I'm lost.
- Since when?

299
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,372
Why does she have
such a hold on you?

300
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:44,424
I don't know what it is about
this woman. I love her.

301
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:48,845
- Maybe it's a whole mother thing.
- Your mother's alive. Let me take <i>her.</i>

302
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:52,057
She gives me confidence. I love her.
What do you want me to say?

303
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:54,260
I'm scared enough as it is.

304
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:57,688
Jesus, Lou, is this more
serious than I thought?

305
00:18:57,814 --> 00:19:03,235
I haven't had a night's sleep trying to
figure out what to do with my life, OK?

306
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:06,446
So all of a sudden
I gotta be the beard?

307
00:19:06,573 --> 00:19:11,912
I want her there. I gotta know she's
there and I gotta know she loves me.

308
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:16,082
I can only say, as your friend and your
manager, you're a sick individual...

309
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:20,075
but if that's what you want,
all right, we'll do it.

310
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,832
Tina? Danny Rose. Had no trouble
getting here at all. None at all.

311
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:04,334
Are you ready?
Cos I'm double-parked.

312
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:07,833
Lou, you can drop dead! That's
what you been sayin' for months!

313
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:12,131
Yeah, well, I don't buy it and I'm damn
sick and tired of all your stories!

314
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:16,890
Don't tell me that, Lou. Bein' married's one
thing, but two-timing's somethin' else!

315
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:22,261
Well, that's just a bunch of garbage. I
don't buy it and you better watch yourself!

316
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,444
I don't care how important it is!
It's too damn bad if you're upset.

317
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,520
The way you treat me, you're lucky I don't
stick an ice pick in your goddamn chest!

318
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:33,611
Like hell I'll be there!
You know what you can do!

319
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:36,614
Goddamn phoney.

320
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:41,041
- Lou tells me you're an interior decorator.
- I don't wanna hear Lou's name.

321
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:45,035
I don't want a run-around.
I don't want any crap, goddamnit!

322
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:47,461
Darling, sweetheart, darling...

323
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:51,126
might I interject one notion at
this juncture? How old are you?

324
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:55,425
- None of your goddamn business!
- I'm serious, darling. You're upset.

325
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:58,724
- What sign are you? Gemini?
- Shut up! Will you just shut up?

326
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:01,604
May I make one statement?

327
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,431
My father... may he rest in peace...
would say maturity, tolerance...

328
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,939
a willingness to give, that's all.

329
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,688
Look, it's a big night for Lou.
Don't ruin it for him.

330
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:14,943
- I don't wanna talk to that creep.
- What happened?

331
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:17,532
- Go to hell!
- May I make one statement?

332
00:21:17,663 --> 00:21:20,829
- I don't mean to be didactic.
- What are you talkin' about?

333
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,745
The man's crazy about you.
He's nuts for you.

334
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:27,542
I got friends who told me he was out
last night with a cheap blonde.

335
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:32,335
A cheap blonde? Lou? A cheap blonde?
Would he fall for a cheap blonde?

336
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:35,755
- I... You know, the man has class.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

337
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:39,590
Yes, of course. Sweetheart, I promise
you, he's cheating with <i>you.</i>

338
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:44,187
He's got integrity. He cheats with one
person at a time only. That's his style.

339
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:48,692
My friends told me he was at the track last
night with his arm around a cheap blonde.

340
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:52,982
Because they bother him cos he's cute.
They try and grab, he pushes them away.

341
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:55,487
When he pushes them away,
his arm goes around.

342
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:58,322
Knock it off. You think I buy that?

343
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:02,154
His wife is a blonde. She's not cheap.
A lovely woman. Educated.

344
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:07,036
She's a cocktail waitress. And they don't
all hustle, no matter what you say.

345
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,578
- What the hell do you want?
- Don't upset him.

346
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:13,843
- I'm not coming. You got that? Drop dead!
- I wanna speak to him.

347
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:18,927
Hello? Lou? Lou, yes. Lou, it's me.

348
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:23,719
I got here OK, Lou. The directions
were good. It was a Gulf station.

349
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:27,353
Lou, she seems to
be a little upset.

350
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:33,730
Tina! Tina! Hey, Tina!

351
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:36,022
- Will you get lost?
- Where you going?

352
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:38,863
I got other things on my
mind besides two-timers.

353
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:41,699
No, the man adores you.
The man is crazy about you.

354
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,080
- He wants you ringside.
- What the hell did you come so early for?

355
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,201
I come every place early.

356
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:50,420
- You're hours early.
- I know, cos tonight's a big night.

357
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:53,963
Milton is coming tonight.
Remember Milton, Tuesday nights?

358
00:22:54,092 --> 00:22:56,465
He'd come out in a woman's
dress. Remember?

359
00:22:56,595 --> 00:22:59,512
If I'm so important to him,
why does he two-time me?

360
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,973
You got it wrong. You got it wrong,
sweetheart. Women annoy him.

361
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:06,885
He sings and they
mentally undress him.

362
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:11,316
I see an adventure.

363
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:14,479
Yes, a trip.

364
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:18,563
A man in a grey suit, who owns
a dog, will come to see you.

365
00:23:20,077 --> 00:23:23,327
- That's Tommy.
- Tommy?

366
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:28,082
- When is he coming?
- Very soon. When you least expect it.

367
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,452
- What are you doing here?
- Shh!

368
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:35,791
- At least call Lou. Call Lou.
- No. Will you just get outta here?

369
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:39,425
The man is nervous. I know
he doesn't seem so, but...

370
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:43,006
- She wants to get ahead.
- Well, you know, I've been waiting.

371
00:23:43,141 --> 00:23:45,300
- My nephew's ill.
- He's ill?

372
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:49,563
- Yeah, and he has a lump on his neck.
- A lump on his neck? That's terrible.

373
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,097
God bless you, sweetheart.
How old are you?

374
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:54,689
- 78.
- You're 78 years old? That's wonderful.

375
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,694
- What are your hobbies?
- Fish.

376
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:58,861
- Tropical fish?
- Tropical fish.

377
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:04,151
My uncle Menachem, may he rest in peace,
a wonderful man, raised hamsters.

378
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:07,739
I personally found 'em disgusting,
but the man adored them.

379
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:11,326
Like you probably feel about
your whatever, your guppies.

380
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:15,293
These are wonderful people, of your
persuasion. Lou is of your persuasion.

381
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:17,749
- Lou's a liar.
- He loves you like a mother.

382
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:20,802
- Excuse me. Come on in.
- That crap about his bad marriage.

383
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,049
The man loves her like
a mother. He adores her.

384
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:29,224
- I have a lover who I think is unfaithful.
- Angelina, might I interject one concept?

385
00:24:29,354 --> 00:24:33,222
He is unfaithful. And
yet he cares for you.

386
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:37,268
See? He cares for you.
God bless you, God bless you.

387
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:39,029
- Don't go to him.
- I won't.

388
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:41,445
- Time out.
- See friends.

389
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:47,613
Resolve all situations, even if it
means travelling long distances.

390
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:50,834
- But be careful.
- Where you going? Tina!

391
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:55,127
Lou, we're into a definite
type of situation here.

392
00:24:55,255 --> 00:24:58,422
No. Definitely, Lou.
Lou, definitely.

393
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,919
We're... Lou, we're into a
complete type of situation.

394
00:25:02,054 --> 00:25:05,090
This is a complete definite
type of situation.

395
00:25:05,224 --> 00:25:08,308
Why's she so mad at me?
What did I do?

396
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:12,272
Won't she even speak to me?

397
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:16,647
- I need a drink.
- Lou, Lou, don't get the jitters.

398
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:20,110
You get nervous, your performance
goes right into the toilet.

399
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:23,524
You start drinking... Lou,
I'll get her there, I promise.

400
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:27,158
Just let me work out the logistics.

401
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:29,327
Tina! Tina!

402
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,999
Tina!

403
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:36,586
And now it's the big day and
things are starting to go wrong.

404
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:39,833
- Lou is boozing a bit.
- I remember him with the Cutty Sark.

405
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:43,003
- Now, she splits. She splits.
- The girlfriend?

406
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:45,421
<i>And Danny follows.</i>

407
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:48,675
<i>She drives and she drives
way the hell out somewhere.</i>

408
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:52,427
<i>Danny's right on her heels,
but you know how Danny drives.</i>

409
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:55,398
<i>She winds up an hour
later God knows where.</i>

410
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:58,441
<i>She's taking Angelina the
fortune-teller's advice.</i>

411
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:01,320
<i>She's winding up some
business with old friends.</i>

412
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:05,989
- Tina, we didn't think you were coming.
- Hi, guys. You look handsome!

413
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:08,609
Yeah, well, I had a
change in plans.

414
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:11,319
Great. OK, the party can begin.

415
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:41,731
- Can we help you, sir?
- I'm with Tina. I'm a friend of Tina's.

416
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:44,816
God bless you. Stay where you are.
You're doing an aces job.

417
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:47,866
I'll check back with
you on my way out.

418
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:50,864
- I'll leave something nice for you.
- All right.

419
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:57,199
- Who are you?
- I'm here with Tina.

420
00:26:57,336 --> 00:27:00,372
- I'm her uncle. Rocco.
- Danny Rose.

421
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:02,794
- What do you do?
- Theatrical management.

422
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,834
- What are you lookin' for?
- Tina.

423
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:07,922
Relax. You gotta be
around her every second?

424
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:10,012
- What do you do, Rocco?
- Cement.

425
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,382
- Cement?
- I own a fleet of cement mixers.

426
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:16,598
No kidding? Isn't that a very
big organised cr...? Cement.

427
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,641
That's fantastic. You always need cement.
That's what's great about cement.

428
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:26,439
- It's not like tape recorders...
- Annie, this is Tina's new boyfriend.

429
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:29,195
Hello. How long you been
going out with my niece?

430
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:32,825
- No, we don't go out. We're just friends.
- Yeah. I know Tina.

431
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:36,952
- Vinnie! Danny's in show business.
- I'm just a friend.

432
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:39,491
- He's a manager.
- You know Jackie Whalen?

433
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:44,290
- Yeah, he's a comedian. He's very funny.
- I don't think he's funny. I think he's dirty.

434
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:48,043
Today everything is, with the
pornography, all the four-letter words.

435
00:27:48,178 --> 00:27:51,096
- It's all filthy.
- I saw this guy in Atlantic City.

436
00:27:51,223 --> 00:27:54,426
He had a cigar box.
And he cuts a hole in it.

437
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,427
Then he goes backstage, he opens
up his fly and he sticks his thing in it.

438
00:27:58,564 --> 00:28:02,644
Then he goes outside, down to ringside to
some old lady's table, opens up the box.

439
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:05,563
- That's humour?
- They call me old-fashioned...

440
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:10,938
but if it's old-fashioned to like Mr Danny
Kaye, Mr Bob Hope, Mr Milton Berle...

441
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:13,947
then all right,
then I'm old-fashioned.

442
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:18,078
- Tina, can't we discuss it?
- No, we discussed it a hundred times.

443
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:21,162
- Then why did you come here today?
- I don't know.

444
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:23,916
- I guess I shouldn't have.
- Tina, I love you.

445
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:27,582
- No. No, it's over.
- If I thought that, I'd kill myself.

446
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,837
- Johnny, don't talk like that.
- And you know I'd do it, too.

447
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:33,260
- You're too emotional.
- I wrote you a poem.

448
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,846
I shouldn't have come.
I'm too mixed up myself.

449
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:38,645
- It's about our month in Sicily.
- Can't you forget it?

450
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,893
We strolled on cliffs of stone

451
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:43,311
Like Greeks of ancient times.

452
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:46,015
Your hair blew this way and that

453
00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:48,478
Mixed with bits of sand.

454
00:28:48,614 --> 00:28:50,274
Our eyes met

455
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:52,898
And then looked out toward the sea

456
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:55,704
- The blue Aegean.
- Tina...

457
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:58,035
- We laughed and...
- What are <i>you</i> doin' here?

458
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:01,166
- I know what you're thinking. Pushy?
- I'm readin' a poem.

459
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:03,618
I'm sorry. I came to get you.

460
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:06,327
I wanna know what
you're doing here.

461
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:08,671
- I want you to come with me.
- Who are you?

462
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,261
Danny Rose, theatrical management.
Might I get five minutes with the lady?

463
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:17,885
Listen, you know I'm dying to come to the
Waldorf. But I've been hurt, that's all.

464
00:29:18,018 --> 00:29:22,763
So this is who's been sending you the
single white rose every day? Danny Rose.

465
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:24,937
How do you know about
the white roses?

466
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,937
Believe me, I know more about
you than you think I know.

467
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,940
- Might I interject...?
- You know because you spy on me.

468
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:35,022
It's not spying when you care about
someone, what's happening to them.

469
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,822
Yeah, you check my mailbox in my
apartment when I'm not there. Admit it.

470
00:29:39,957 --> 00:29:43,871
So you prefer him with his white roses
to me and all we were to each other?

471
00:29:44,002 --> 00:29:47,834
I prefer someone that has
respect for me and doesn't spy!

472
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:52,425
Are you going with him?

473
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:54,462
Tina, can I get one...? Tina.

474
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:07,273
- What are you doing with money?
- Are you a big shot, tearing your money?

475
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:10,105
I been tearing money since
my first Holy Communion.

476
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:12,562
See this? 10 dollars. I don't care.

477
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:14,986
- Here. What does it mean?
- 20, 20.

478
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:18,486
20? 20, 40, 60 dollars.

479
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,404
What does it mean, you know?
It means nothin'.

480
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,866
Mere fascination, that's all it is.

481
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:28,160
Yeah, I wanna see Lou,
but he treats me lousy.

482
00:30:28,297 --> 00:30:31,001
Well, Lou's crazy about you.
I'm telling you.

483
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,706
Tonight's a big shot
for him, really.

484
00:30:33,844 --> 00:30:36,761
Lou's not a kid. He's
trying to make a comeback.

485
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:40,222
When he sings "That's Amore",
that for me is the end.

486
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,562
Isn't it unbelievable what he does
with that song? Isn't that fantastic?

487
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:49,599
I'm gonna hit you with one word. I'm
gonna say just one word. Sorrento. OK?

488
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:51,608
Sorrento. Am I lying?

489
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:56,399
I like it when he takes the microphone off
the stand and starts to sort of throw it.

490
00:30:56,533 --> 00:31:00,032
- That's my gesture. I gave him that.
- No. I saw him years ago.

491
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:03,862
- He took the microphone off.
- But he didn't throw it from hand to hand.

492
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:06,205
I gave him that touch.
I used to do that.

493
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:09,336
So you taught him to throw the
microphone from hand to hand.

494
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:12,132
I taught him everything.
I gave him his gestures...

495
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:15,009
I handle his budget, I pick
his clothes, his songs.

496
00:31:15,135 --> 00:31:17,424
And you manage his love life.

497
00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:22,300
My father... may he rest in peace... said
"In business, friendly but not familiar."

498
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:26,479
But what am I gonna do? This is personal
management. It's a key word. Personal.

499
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:30,685
So, you know, I gotta get involved.
Like Herbie Jayson, my bird act.

500
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:34,946
A cat ate the lead bird. So I gotta
leap right into the breach, you know.

501
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:37,111
Or my Puerto Rican ventriloquist.

502
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:40,692
He's got everything you need to make
it big, but he's a dope addict.

503
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:44,659
- So I gotta get in there and help.
- What can I say?

504
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,625
Now that I see you, I'm the
wrong guy to be the beard.

505
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:51,085
Who'd believe that such a
beautiful girl would date me?

506
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:53,289
- Come on.
- No, I'm telling the truth.

507
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:55,582
- My hand to God.
- I'm not beautiful.

508
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:58,043
I see a lot of singers
and actresses. You are.

509
00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:01,629
- Well, you're not so terrible.
- Yeah. I know one thing, honey.

510
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:04,885
I'm never gonna be Cary Grant,
I don't care what anybody says.

511
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:07,509
Can I get a sip of that?

512
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:11,975
Can I tell you a secret? I'm not just
trying to make you feel good or anything.

513
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:12,939
Yeah.

514
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:17,196
A handsome man never did anything
for me. You know what turns me on?

515
00:32:17,322 --> 00:32:21,569
Intellectual. I'm not just saying this
to make you feel good or anything.

516
00:32:21,702 --> 00:32:26,577
You're a smooth talker. Angelina once
even predicted I would marry a Jew.

517
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:31,001
- Did she happen to say which Jew?
- A Jew or someone musical.

518
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:35,671
Listen, now we're talking about something
musical, could you go call Lou?

519
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,124
Cos the guy needs you.
Give him a call.

520
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:43,254
Cos it's late. We'll get right outta
here. Please. Please, darling.

521
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,391
No, Lou. No, it's not
that I hate you.

522
00:32:46,518 --> 00:32:50,219
It's just that, you know,
you get me angry sometimes.

523
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:54,139
Yeah. I'm gonna... I was always
gonna be there. I'll be there.

524
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:56,849
Will you listen to me?
I'm coming, OK?

525
00:32:56,987 --> 00:33:00,486
It's just that sometimes
you get me crazy.

526
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:02,904
Yeah. Yeah.

527
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,450
Oh, my God. Look!

528
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:09,326
It's him! She betrayed me with him.

529
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,166
Danny Rose!

530
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:17,047
Oh, my God! He drank iodine!

531
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:19,581
He seduced her away from me!

532
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:23,052
Were you seeing Tina while
she was going with Johnny?

533
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,303
Would I do something like that? No!

534
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:28,599
Then who sent the white
roses, one every day?

535
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:32,891
Johnny! Johnny, what happened?

536
00:33:33,023 --> 00:33:34,850
What happened? Tell Mommy.

537
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:38,648
My son is sensitive. He's a poet.

538
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:41,234
<i>È un poeta, figlio mío.</i>

539
00:33:41,782 --> 00:33:44,533
He's fantastic.
How old are you, Johnny?

540
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,993
- He's 40.
- He's 40. Unbelievable. Are you an Aries?

541
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:51,621
- Just tell me, are you an Aries?
- Johnny's been made a fool out of.

542
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,122
No! No!

543
00:33:54,253 --> 00:33:57,040
They forced him to wear the horns!

544
00:33:57,172 --> 00:33:59,295
<i>Le corna, capite?</i>

545
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:03,552
We were engaged until
he put a spell on her!

546
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:09,517
You know, this man's a beautiful man.
He is a fantastic individual.

547
00:34:09,643 --> 00:34:12,264
<i>Vendetta</i>! <i>Vendetta</i>!

548
00:34:12,396 --> 00:34:18,315
<i>Lo giuro davanti allá madonna,
Johnny, lo giura mamma tua.</i>

549
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:27,197
Boy, that guy Johnny must have
really been crazy about you.

550
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:30,945
I like to flirt, you know. Sometimes
people take it too seriously.

551
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:34,699
Johnny's all right. He was really nice
to me when my marriage fell apart.

552
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:37,373
And what did your husband do?

553
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:42,332
A little bookmaking, some
loansharking, extortion, like that.

554
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:46,417
So he's a professional man. You divorced
him or you got a separation or what?

555
00:34:46,555 --> 00:34:48,713
Some guy shot him in the eyes.

556
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:50,758
- Really? He's blind?
- Dead.

557
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:53,977
He's dead, of course, cos the
bullets go right through.

558
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:57,354
Oh, my God, you poor thing.
It must have been a shock.

559
00:34:57,482 --> 00:34:59,641
- He had it coming.
- Oh, I see.

560
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:02,149
It was one of those.
A close marriage.

561
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:05,695
It was exciting. You never knew
what was gonna happen next.

562
00:35:05,824 --> 00:35:08,659
That kind of excitement
I can live without.

563
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:10,825
He was tough, good-looking.

564
00:35:10,954 --> 00:35:14,489
- What did he tell you he did?
- Juice man for the Mob.

565
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:17,032
- He made juice for the Mob?
- Juice man.

566
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:19,541
No. He collected for
the loan sharks.

567
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:24,463
<i>OK, so now Danny's driving along
with Tina. They're talking.</i>

568
00:35:24,593 --> 00:35:27,345
<i>What they don't know is after
they left the party...</i>

569
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:31,385
<i>there was this scene with Johnny
Rispoli's brothers, Joe and Vito...</i>

570
00:35:31,516 --> 00:35:33,889
<i>who are both hit men for the Mob.</i>

571
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:36,475
<i>Their mother is outraged
and humiliated...</i>

572
00:35:36,605 --> 00:35:41,812
<i>over what's been goin' on with Danny
Rose, who they call Danny White Roses.</i>

573
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:44,316
Don't worry, Mama. You
just leave him to us.

574
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:48,278
Your brother is soft.
He's sensitive.

575
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:52,620
Her husband had no respect for us either.
Carmine Vitale, he was no damn good.

576
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:55,118
He cheated us. And she's no better.

577
00:35:55,249 --> 00:35:58,415
She said one thing to my
face and she betrayed me.

578
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:02,921
It's the lover. He's got her
under his spell, Johnny.

579
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:05,420
- We'll fix him.
- We'll chop his legs off.

580
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:08,551
No. We'll kill him.
I don't trust him.

581
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:11,514
But not Tina. Please, not Tina.

582
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,183
Get rid of the lover. Get rid of
the lover and you get her back.

583
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:18,351
He's got the evil eye.

584
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,478
<i>C'ha il malocchio.</i> You understand,
<i>figlio mío? Il malocchio.</i>

585
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:25,396
Mama, he's a dead man.

586
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,942
- I'll just have an iced coffee.
- I'm gonna have a glass of milk. Large.

587
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:34,825
I got an ulcer. I shouldn't have drank
at the party. That was my mistake.

588
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:37,031
My ex-husband had an ulcer.

589
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:40,617
They say it's stress. It's an
entire mental syndrome.

590
00:36:40,752 --> 00:36:45,213
Yeah. Carmine was always afraid they
were gonna shoot him in the back.

591
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,377
He was wrong, so...

592
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,297
So who else have you
handled besides Lou?

593
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:56,768
Me? I got... I got... I have
various interesting artists.

594
00:36:56,894 --> 00:37:02,184
I got a very wonderful blind xylophone
player, you know, that's...

595
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:07,902
I got a... I'm currently working with
a parrot that sings "I Gotta Be Me".

596
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,324
And I got some very nice balloon-folders,
you know. It's interesting.

597
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:14,408
No big shots, right?

598
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:19,412
I don't know. I've discovered certain
artists that have gone on to better things.

599
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:22,578
Yeah, but they all
leave you, right? How come?

600
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:25,546
I got a theory about that,
you know. Thank you.

601
00:37:25,672 --> 00:37:29,172
I think what happens is they get a
swellhead, you know what I mean?

602
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:33,299
People like to forget their
beginnings and they just split.

603
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,680
You must be doin' somethin'
wrong if everybody leaves you.

604
00:37:36,808 --> 00:37:38,931
How? What am I doing wrong?

605
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:42,809
I find 'em, I discover 'em, I breathe
life into 'em and then they go.

606
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,558
And no guilt. They don't feel guilty
or anything. They just split.

607
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:50,773
Guilty? What the hell is that? They see
somethin' better and they grab it.

608
00:37:50,906 --> 00:37:54,275
- Who's got time for guilt?
- Guilt is important.

609
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:59,451
It's important to feel guilty, otherwise
you're capable of terrible things.

610
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:04,208
It's very important to be guilty. I'm guilty
all the time and I never did anything.

611
00:38:04,336 --> 00:38:09,081
My rabbi, Rabbi Peristein, used to say
we're all guilty in the eyes of God.

612
00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:13,344
- You believe in God?
- No. But I'm guilty over it.

613
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:18,346
I never feel guilty. I just think you
gotta do what you gotta do, you know.

614
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:22,520
Life's short. You don't get any
medals for bein' a boy scout.

615
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:27,059
Well, do me a favour, darling.
Don't give this information to Lou.

616
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:29,185
- I got enough problems.
- Don't move.

617
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:32,771
- What's the matter?
- Just get up slowly and get outta here.

618
00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:36,951
- I don't understand? What's out there?
- Johnny's brothers.

619
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:40,861
- You mean the guy with the iodine?
- They're crazy, that whole family.

620
00:38:40,998 --> 00:38:45,706
- Why? Because they think I'm your lover?
- They'll tear the tongue outta your head.

621
00:38:45,836 --> 00:38:49,205
I'm just a beard. They'll tear
the tongue outta the beard?

622
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:51,332
Throw some money down. Let's go.

623
00:38:51,466 --> 00:38:54,503
- What do you mean? I only got 10 bucks.
- Leave it.

624
00:38:54,678 --> 00:38:58,177
- Just leave it. Come on, will ya?
- The check is a dollar and a half.

625
00:38:58,307 --> 00:39:02,518
- An eight-and-a-half-dollar tip.
- There oughta be a delivery entrance.

626
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:06,476
For that kind of dough I could get
the waitress to sleep with me.

627
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:09,276
Where's the...? There it is!

628
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,768
Don't get up. Keep turning
out the junk food.

629
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:18,440
- Come on! This way.
- I don't like this.

630
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:23,702
Darling, darling, may I interject one
statement? I don't like what's going on.

631
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:28,992
- Oh, Christ! Better go down there.
- What the hell did you get me into?

632
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:31,964
Do what I'm telling you.
You'll wind up on a meat hook.

633
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,416
A meat hook? A meat hook?

634
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:37,007
OK. I'll go first.

635
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:41,424
- I'm angry. I'm telling you, I'm angry.
- Hurry up and get down.

636
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:44,096
I'm really fuming.

637
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:48,557
Just feel free to dig your
heel into my groin like that.

638
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,589
So Danny and Tina, they run.

639
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:19,678
What's he gonna do? Now he is not
only scared. The man is pissed off.

640
00:40:19,805 --> 00:40:23,470
- Sure. Because he didn't do anything.
- You got it.

641
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,309
Wait, wait, wait. Cut to a half-hour later.
It's a half-hour later. Now they're lost.

642
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:30,478
They're lost. And he's furious.

643
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:34,142
He's getting on her nerves.
She's getting on his nerves.

644
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:38,525
- Jesus! Where the hell are we?
- All right, take it easy.

645
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:42,275
Don't tell me to take it easy, because
I've had enough already today.

646
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:45,115
I'm a personal manager. I got
a big night ahead of me.

647
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:48,164
Meanwhile I'm wandering
around here in North Vietnam.

648
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:51,625
- We got away, didn't we?
- I got nothing to get away from.

649
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:53,793
I didn't do anything.

650
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:58,086
I'm running all of a sudden with
fortune-tellers and meat hooks.

651
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:00,840
I'll take care of it
when we hit a phone.

652
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:04,885
A phone? We're in a swamp, darling.
Where is there gonna be a phone here?

653
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:07,305
She's with Lou and they
wanna break my legs.

654
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:10,721
- I don't have to go tonight.
- Well, that's fine with me.

655
00:41:10,856 --> 00:41:13,773
Then don't, because I'm too
scared already anyhow.

656
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:18,397
Lou, I wish you wouldn't drink like that.
You've got an important show tonight.

657
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:21,650
I got a cold sore tonight.
Look at this thing over here.

658
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:25,235
- It's nothing.
- It's gotta be tonight. Believe you me.

659
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,537
And those TV people, they notice
everything. They're pros.

660
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:31,583
- They got it down to a science.
- Turn on the ball game.

661
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,161
I can't even decide whether to go
with "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"...

662
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:37,835
or "Three Coins in the
Fountain" as an encore.

663
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:42,545
The kids are driving me nuts over
here. Give me a break over here.

664
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:46,594
I wonder where Danny is. I'm waiting
for his call. I got a million questions.

665
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:50,176
- Where is Danny?
- Went to pick up his date in Jersey.

666
00:41:50,312 --> 00:41:52,850
I guess they probably
got tied up in traffic.

667
00:41:52,981 --> 00:41:56,148
- Who's his date?
- How do I know? Some broad.

668
00:41:56,818 --> 00:42:01,030
- Jesus. We're in the middle of nowhere.
- I never saw so many reeds in my life.

669
00:42:01,156 --> 00:42:04,027
- I feel like Moses.
- Lou's probably worried sick.

670
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,786
Lou is probably drinking out of the
promotional-size whisky bottle by now.

671
00:42:08,914 --> 00:42:12,532
Hey, wait a minute. I know where
we are. These are the flatlands.

672
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:15,123
My husband's friends used
to dump bodies here.

673
00:42:15,254 --> 00:42:18,705
Great. I'm sure you can show me all
the points of cultural interest.

674
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,378
Hey, who are you?

675
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,384
Who are you?

676
00:42:23,512 --> 00:42:27,510
- Who are you?
- We're lost.

677
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:30,642
We're shooting a commercial
down by the river.

678
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:33,260
Fantastic! Unbelievable!

679
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:37,477
What a break! I'm Danny Rose,
theatrical management. God bless you.

680
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:39,898
- This is Tina...
- Vitale.

681
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:43,528
Hi. I'm Ray Webb, the actor.
How you doin', babe?

682
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:46,278
Listen, we gotta get a car.
Is it possible?

683
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,277
- There are no cars out here till tonight.
- We need one now. It's an emergency.

684
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:55,491
I'm a theatrical manager, so I gotta see
Berle at the Waldorf later. Milton Berle.

685
00:42:55,627 --> 00:43:00,123
There's a guy there with a boat. Give him
a couple of bucks. He'll take you across.

686
00:43:00,257 --> 00:43:02,582
- Great, great.
- I don't travel by water.

687
00:43:02,718 --> 00:43:05,505
It's against my religion.
I'm a landlocked Hebrew.

688
00:43:05,637 --> 00:43:09,421
You ever seen me on TV? I play the
shaving-cream man from outer space.

689
00:43:09,558 --> 00:43:11,847
- Wanna feel my cheeks, huh?
- Funny.

690
00:43:11,977 --> 00:43:15,678
Come on, Danny. We gotta take
this boat. Lou's waitin'. Come on.

691
00:43:15,814 --> 00:43:18,103
Five minutes across
the Hudson. It's nothin'.

692
00:43:18,233 --> 00:43:20,938
You want me to go on the
Hudson River? That's crazy!

693
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:23,311
How did you two get out
here without a car?

694
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:26,116
I've been through thick
and thin with that car.

695
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:29,776
- Now I gotta leave it overnight?
- Pick it up tomorrow. It'll be fine.

696
00:43:29,912 --> 00:43:34,158
If anything happens to that car, I'll
be furious, Tina. I will be furious.

697
00:43:42,215 --> 00:43:45,916
<i>OK. Now they're gonna go
back to Manhattan by boat.</i>

698
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:47,761
<i>A boat, mind you.</i>

699
00:43:47,888 --> 00:43:52,514
<i>Can you picture Danny Rose on a boat?
I mean, this guy is strictly pavement.</i>

700
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:56,771
<i>He needs the smell of carbon
monoxide and litter to feel good.</i>

701
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:59,602
<i>Danny is not meant for water.</i>

702
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:03,731
<i>So, naturally, the minute he
steps on the boat, he's gone.</i>

703
00:44:03,862 --> 00:44:08,074
<i>A lunch he ate in 1956 is
beginning to come up on him.</i>

704
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,027
<i>He's green. He's dizzy.</i>

705
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,739
<i>Tina's fine. She's made of steel. I'll
tell you what's going through her mind.</i>

706
00:44:14,873 --> 00:44:19,250
<i>She's thinking of a conversation
that she and Lou had a week before.</i>

707
00:44:20,295 --> 00:44:22,965
- Hey, hey! All right!
- Listen, Lou...

708
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:28,084
I don't want you to break up with
your wife because of me. I don't...

709
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,841
Tina, it's not you. This
has been on my mind.

710
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:34,591
I'd feel like a home-wrecker.
That's what I feel like.

711
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:36,933
I gotta change my whole lifestyle.

712
00:44:37,062 --> 00:44:41,012
The thing you gotta change
is your management.

713
00:44:41,149 --> 00:44:45,396
Listen, Danny's all right. So he's no
world-beater. I mean, he's all right.

714
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:49,990
I know nothin' about show business.
And I got nothin' against the guy...

715
00:44:50,117 --> 00:44:53,450
but I see the joints you work
and the way things are going.

716
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:55,701
You're better than
all these new guys.

717
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:58,867
- You're prejudiced cos you like me.
- Yeah, sure I am.

718
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:02,701
Listen, Danny'd be lost
without me. He's countin' on me.

719
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:04,712
You know what you're doin'.

720
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,413
Why don't you let me introduce
you to Sid Bacharach?

721
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:10,220
How do you know him? Why
would he give me his time?

722
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:14,557
He was good friends with my husband. They
were both very tight in Atlantic City.

723
00:45:14,683 --> 00:45:17,304
- Sid Bacharach, huh?
- He's a big guy, right?

724
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:19,927
Big gun, big gun.
No two ways about it.

725
00:45:20,939 --> 00:45:24,189
<i>OK. Now they're in the
middle of the Hudson River.</i>

726
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:28,232
<i>The fog has come in. Danny's face is...
what colour should I say?</i>

727
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:30,937
<i>It's khaki. The man
has a khaki face.</i>

728
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:34,574
<i>So Tina wanted Lou to leave Danny
and go with Sid Bacharach?</i>

729
00:45:34,703 --> 00:45:37,989
<i>That's exactly what I'm saying.
See, three days earlier...</i>

730
00:45:38,123 --> 00:45:42,203
<i>Tina had set up a secret lunch meeting
at some steak joint in Manhattan.</i>

731
00:45:42,336 --> 00:45:45,954
Well, guys, we finally made it.
Lou Canova, Sid Bacharach.

732
00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:49,541
- Sid, this is Lou.
- A pleasure, Mr Bacharach. Truly.

733
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:52,677
I've only heard wonderful
things about you from Tina.

734
00:45:52,804 --> 00:45:56,387
- She does that all the time.
- No. You remember Lou from the '50s.

735
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:59,802
- He's got it.
- I remember "Tossin' and Turnin'".

736
00:45:59,937 --> 00:46:02,309
That thing on "Perfidia" too.

737
00:46:02,439 --> 00:46:05,357
Now I understand you already
have representation.

738
00:46:05,484 --> 00:46:09,316
He's loyal to a guy who means well
but he can't seem to move him.

739
00:46:09,446 --> 00:46:11,273
I know all about those things...

740
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:15,107
and sometimes it just doesn't
work out and he can't help you.

741
00:46:15,244 --> 00:46:18,992
It's my career. It's my life.
I gotta do what's right for it.

742
00:46:19,122 --> 00:46:23,500
I really wanna catch your act. I know this
nostalgia thing is really coming on strong.

743
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:26,711
- He's hot now.
- I'm gonna be at the Waldorf on the 25th.

744
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:29,875
25th. Be great if you could
come, Sid. He's ready.

745
00:46:30,008 --> 00:46:33,543
All he needs is somebody with a
little clout to open some doors.

746
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:36,134
I'll do my best to make
it on Sunday night.

747
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:38,934
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you in the back.

748
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:41,728
- You won't regret it.
- No problem.

749
00:46:43,897 --> 00:46:49,188
<i>OK. So Tina's thinking about all this stuff
while they're sailing across the Hudson.</i>

750
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:53,697
<i>Meanwhile, the two crazy brothers are
in New York looking to kill Danny.</i>

751
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:57,109
<i>Wasn't Tina gonna make a phone
call and have 'em called off?</i>

752
00:46:57,244 --> 00:47:00,660
<i>She did, the minute they got
ashore, but it didn't work.</i>

753
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:04,490
- So what's happening?
- You're gonna have to lay low for a while.

754
00:47:04,626 --> 00:47:07,746
- What do you mean?
- You got any friends outta town?

755
00:47:07,879 --> 00:47:11,462
- Outta town? Like where? Are you nuts?
- You better check into a hotel.

756
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:13,964
You were gonna settle
this with one phone call.

757
00:47:14,094 --> 00:47:17,677
It's gonna take a few days.
Meanwhile, they're looking for you.

758
00:47:17,806 --> 00:47:20,842
Darling, can I say one thing?
I'm going to the police.

759
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:23,514
No, that's a mistake.
You gotta lay low.

760
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:28,936
Lay low? I didn't do anything! My whole
life I never got involved in any trouble.

761
00:47:29,067 --> 00:47:33,528
I eat the right foods. Now I gotta lay low?
Jesus! You said one phone call.

762
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:36,858
I know. It's gonna be taken care of.
I got someone onto it.

763
00:47:36,992 --> 00:47:40,112
- My advice is to check into a hotel.
- I got an apartment.

764
00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:43,412
- Why do I need a hotel?
- You can't go back there for a few days.

765
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,624
I'm gonna spend for a hotel while
I'm carrying an apartment?

766
00:47:46,752 --> 00:47:49,836
All right, it's a mix-up.
Just don't go home, that's all.

767
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:53,379
I gotta go home. You know,
you're bad news, honey.

768
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:56,426
I knew that when you were starting
with the ice pick on Lou.

769
00:47:56,553 --> 00:47:59,305
Nice girls don't screw
around with ice picks.

770
00:47:59,431 --> 00:48:01,554
- Just don't go home.
- I gotta go home.

771
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:06,511
I gotta get my pills and my shorts. And
Lou, the poor guy, he's probably a wreck.

772
00:48:09,149 --> 00:48:13,017
I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk.

773
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:15,193
I mean, I'm OK.

774
00:48:16,406 --> 00:48:18,980
I'm gonna be all right.

775
00:48:19,117 --> 00:48:22,652
Now where you been?
I'm goin' crazy. Where's Tina?

776
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:28,493
Lou, Lou, take some black coffee and
get over to the Waldorf. She's here.

777
00:48:28,627 --> 00:48:31,628
You speak to him, cos he's lost.
He's gone already.

778
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:34,756
Lou, I'll be there, honey.
Just do what Danny says.

779
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:37,920
- Be nice to him.
- We'll meet you at the place.

780
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:42,181
Of course I miss you. But will you
lay off the sauce? All right.

781
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:45,637
He's drunk. I knew
this was gonna happen.

782
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:49,470
Where are my pills? I need a
Valium the size of a hockey puck.

783
00:48:49,606 --> 00:48:53,438
- Who's this? Who is this here?
- What do you mean? That's Frank.

784
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:56,273
Frank, Tony Bennett and me.
This was a big night.

785
00:48:56,405 --> 00:49:00,782
See me up there? A little tiny smudge
that's like a fingerprint. That's my head.

786
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:04,824
There I am with Miss Judy Garland.
Never a dearer woman existed.

787
00:49:04,955 --> 00:49:07,956
- Where are you?
- Well, I'm right outside of frame.

788
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:12,081
Cos if the picture went on another inch,
I would be... I was back behind the dais.

789
00:49:12,212 --> 00:49:16,506
And here's Mr Myron Cohen and...
Jesus, where is my bottle of pills?

790
00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:21,260
- How long have you had this joint?
- Joint? This is rent-controlled.

791
00:49:21,388 --> 00:49:25,053
You oughta fix it up.
You're living like a loser.

792
00:49:25,183 --> 00:49:27,390
Nobody ever comes over,
so what do I care?

793
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:30,390
Nobody comes over?
You ever been married?

794
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:32,978
No. I was engaged once
to a dancer, you know...

795
00:49:33,108 --> 00:49:37,521
but she ran away with a piano
player and I broke off with her.

796
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:39,943
- You know what I'd do with this room?
- What?

797
00:49:40,073 --> 00:49:44,534
Liven it up. Do it all in somethin'
up, you know. Pink, maybe?

798
00:49:44,661 --> 00:49:47,615
- Pink?
- Yeah. You know, you gotta lighten it up.

799
00:49:47,748 --> 00:49:52,908
Pink with maybe some gold wallpaper.
And you need fabric, you know.

800
00:49:53,045 --> 00:49:57,089
Like big purple pillows or somethin'.
Maybe some incense.

801
00:49:57,215 --> 00:49:59,967
What is this? A Turkish
whorehouse? I live here.

802
00:50:00,093 --> 00:50:05,468
I'm serious. You gotta lighten it up.
Maybe some bamboo furniture. Bamboo.

803
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,383
I always wanted to do a room in
bamboo with, like, zebra skins.

804
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,307
- Really? Are you serious?
- Why not? It's exciting.

805
00:50:12,439 --> 00:50:16,353
What you're talking about is
like a tropical motif, right?

806
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:20,103
- It's funny, cos actually I like bamboo.
- Really?

807
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,236
Picture, like, hanging plants maybe,
and a really nice tile floor.

808
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:27,618
Bamboo furniture. It's very
beautiful and very dramatic.

809
00:50:27,746 --> 00:50:30,533
- You got an eye for drama.
- You really think so?

810
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:32,457
You sound surprised.

811
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:36,000
Nobody ever liked my
African-jungle idea before.

812
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:39,913
I always had this as a dream.
You're the first person ever liked it.

813
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:44,214
I'm willing to bet that you're full of
good ideas, but you lack confidence.

814
00:50:44,346 --> 00:50:48,344
- You don't have any confidence.
- It's my big problem as a decorator.

815
00:50:48,475 --> 00:50:53,517
Sure, it's like the acts I handle. I could
straighten you out in no time at all.

816
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:58,558
Cos I don't see you just decorating little
joints and little apartments in the suburbs.

817
00:50:58,694 --> 00:51:02,110
I see you doing your gold walls
and your Turkish pillows...

818
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:05,822
and all that garbage in hotels
and embassies and stuff.

819
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:07,908
- Really?
- Yeah, naturally.

820
00:51:08,036 --> 00:51:10,788
- You could. I can smell it.
- I don't think so.

821
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:14,829
The boat's sailed for me. I should have
been more serious when I was younger.

822
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,712
Younger? You got your
whole life ahead of you.

823
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,456
The trouble is I look at my
work and I think it's ugly.

824
00:51:21,592 --> 00:51:25,292
Well, my uncle Morris, the
famous diabetic from Brooklyn...

825
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:28,762
used to say "If you hate yourself,
then you hate your work."

826
00:51:28,891 --> 00:51:31,808
I sleep at night. It's you
that's got the ulcer.

827
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:36,396
I got an ulcer, but it may be a good thing.
You know what my philosophy of life is?

828
00:51:36,523 --> 00:51:40,735
That it's important to have some laughs,
but you gotta suffer a little too...

829
00:51:40,861 --> 00:51:44,111
because otherwise you miss
the whole point to life.

830
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:46,813
- Know what my philosophy of life is?
- I can imagine.

831
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:50,568
It's over quick, so have a good time.
You see want you want, go for it.

832
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:55,745
Don't pay attention to anyone else. Do it to
the other guy first, or he'll do it to you.

833
00:51:55,876 --> 00:52:01,001
This is a philosophy of life? It sounds like
the screenplay to "Murder Incorporated".

834
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:04,547
Hold this. That's ridiculous. No
wonder you don't like yourself.

835
00:52:04,676 --> 00:52:07,132
Stop saying that.
I like myself fine.

836
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:09,551
Down deep, I sense that you don't.

837
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:13,382
- You're the one that's livin' like a loser.
- Why? Cos I haven't made it?

838
00:52:13,518 --> 00:52:15,760
That's the beauty of this business.

839
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:18,268
Overnight you can go
from a bum to a hero.

840
00:52:18,398 --> 00:52:21,767
- I think it's gonna happen now with Lou.
- We better get going.

841
00:52:21,902 --> 00:52:26,730
Just let me say one thing. My uncle
Sidney... lovely uncle, dead, completely...

842
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:30,281
used to say three things:
Acceptance, forgiveness and love.

843
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:35,867
That is a philosophy of life: Acceptance,
forgiveness and love. There's where it is.

844
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:38,288
So tell me more about
the bamboo room.

845
00:52:52,307 --> 00:52:55,723
I'm gonna stay one night. One night.
Cos I don't wanna incur expense.

846
00:52:55,852 --> 00:52:58,937
I'm gonna make a phone call.
I got another idea.

847
00:53:11,243 --> 00:53:14,742
- How much is a single room?
- Sorry. All filled up.

848
00:53:27,968 --> 00:53:30,007
Tina?

849
00:53:31,138 --> 00:53:33,177
Tina?

850
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,140
Tina, darling?

851
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:54,282
Hello, Danny.

852
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:57,869
Get in the car!

853
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:05,543
Get in the car!

854
00:54:19,061 --> 00:54:20,697
Fellas... Fellas, can I...

855
00:54:20,723 --> 00:54:24,875
May I just interject one thing at
this particular point in time?

856
00:54:24,983 --> 00:54:28,933
- Keep goin' straight.
- Look, I like Johnny. I like your brother.

857
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:32,819
I got nothing against him. I just
met him today. I liked his poem.

858
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:37,612
What's under discussion here is the
girl's feelings. Where is the girl?

859
00:54:37,746 --> 00:54:40,284
We're gonna take real
good care of you, pal.

860
00:54:40,415 --> 00:54:44,627
I wanna say one thing, and I don't mean
to be didactic or facetious in any manner.

861
00:54:44,753 --> 00:54:48,039
She doesn't love him. She
doesn't love him any more.

862
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:52,502
I know it's hard to take. Because we
all want what we can't have in life.

863
00:54:52,636 --> 00:54:58,342
It's a natural thing, but take my
cousin Ceil. Not pretty like Tina at all.

864
00:54:58,475 --> 00:55:01,642
She looks like something in
a reptile house in a zoo.

865
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,226
- She meets this accountant...
- Will you shut up?!

866
00:55:16,243 --> 00:55:18,282
Wait, wait, wait. No.

867
00:55:18,412 --> 00:55:20,819
You misunderstand me.

868
00:55:20,956 --> 00:55:24,704
- Goddamn you!
- I'm trying to make a point.

869
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:27,919
Fellas, fellas, I'm a veteran.
I'm a veteran.

870
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:32,002
- Get the axe.
- There's an axe?

871
00:55:32,134 --> 00:55:35,467
Fellas, I'm the beard. I'm just
a beard. You don't understand.

872
00:55:35,596 --> 00:55:38,929
He's telling the truth. He
has nothing to do with this.

873
00:55:39,057 --> 00:55:41,679
You don't believe me, right?

874
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:45,309
- We're gonna chop your legs off.
- Fellas, I'm only the beard.

875
00:55:45,439 --> 00:55:48,309
Would I waste my time
with a guy like this?

876
00:55:48,442 --> 00:55:52,392
Then who? You want him to walk outta
here, you have to give us a name.

877
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:55,151
- I'm not talking.
- No, you tell us, you punk.

878
00:55:55,282 --> 00:55:58,069
You don't want me to rat
on a friend, do you?

879
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:01,368
Let me quote Rabbi Hirschhorn,
an extremely learned man...

880
00:56:01,496 --> 00:56:04,616
- ...perhaps not of your persuasion.
- Who you bearding for?

881
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:08,249
- I'm not the guy. Isn't that enough?
- You two are dead men.

882
00:56:08,378 --> 00:56:11,712
Oh, yeah? Who you bearding
for, you little cheese eater?

883
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,419
Cheese... I don't know exactly what
it means, but I know it's not good.

884
00:56:16,553 --> 00:56:19,839
Who are you bearding for? I'll put
a bullet right between her eyes!

885
00:56:19,973 --> 00:56:23,342
- Don't do that! I'll talk!
- Danny, don't! They'll kill him!

886
00:56:23,477 --> 00:56:26,680
I don't wanna get my legs chopped
off cos I do a guy a favour.

887
00:56:26,813 --> 00:56:29,684
- Who is it?
- All right, you wanna know who it is?

888
00:56:29,816 --> 00:56:34,644
Should I tell you who it is?
Should I say? It's... Barney Dunn.

889
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,404
Who's Barney Dunn?

890
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:38,571
- Who is it?!
- Danny, you rat!

891
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,116
- Shut up!
- I don't owe you anything over this.

892
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:45,864
Fellas, I swear on my
life, it's Barney Dunn.

893
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:49,202
And, Barney, may God forgive me.

894
00:56:49,336 --> 00:56:52,669
- Who?
- Barney Dunn. You know Barney Dunn.

895
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:53,747
Barney Dunn.

896
00:56:53,882 --> 00:56:55,424
I can't hear ya.

897
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:59,299
<i>Barney Dunn was the world's
worst ventriloquist.</i>

898
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:02,929
<i>If they couldn't get an animal
act, they would call Barney Dunn.</i>

899
00:57:03,058 --> 00:57:07,767
<i>Barney would work children's parties.
Five-year-old kids would boo him.</i>

900
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:10,470
<i>Two weeks ago Danny, who
doesn't handle Barney...</i>

901
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:14,142
<i>that'll tell you about Barney,
Danny didn't wanna handle him...</i>

902
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:16,484
<i>Danny meets Barney on the street.</i>

903
00:57:16,613 --> 00:57:21,026
- How you doin', Barney? How's it goin'?
- I'm leaving on a c-cruise tomorrow.

904
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:24,943
- You're kidding? Where for?
- I'm working a s-s-ship to the B-Bahamas.

905
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,208
- Fantastic. And then back here?
- No. And here's the b-b-beauty part.

906
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:33,249
From the B-Bahamas to P-Puerto
Rico for th-three weeks.

907
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,411
Fantastic.

908
00:57:34,548 --> 00:57:37,300
- <i>So Danny names Barney Dunn.</i>
- <i>Can't they check that?</i>

909
00:57:37,426 --> 00:57:41,922
<i>They do check it. They tie up Danny
and Tina and they go to check it.</i>

910
00:57:42,931 --> 00:57:47,309
What am I doing here? How did
I get into this? Why me?

911
00:57:47,436 --> 00:57:50,306
What did I do to deserve
this that I'm here now?

912
00:57:50,439 --> 00:57:53,190
You were really quick to come
up with that name so fast.

913
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:57,564
Great. That's wonderful. Let me tell you
something, darling. I was traumatised.

914
00:57:57,696 --> 00:58:00,863
My body went into shock when
they stuck that gun in you.

915
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:03,862
I thought they're gonna kill
us, I'm gonna be dead...

916
00:58:03,994 --> 00:58:06,911
and Milton is coming
to the Waldorf soon.

917
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,573
Listen, they're gonna be back in a
minute. We gotta do something.

918
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:13,414
I can't move a finger.
I'm tied up here like a pig.

919
00:58:13,545 --> 00:58:15,917
- If we could get outta these ropes.
- I can't.

920
00:58:16,048 --> 00:58:18,835
They just left one guy out there.
There's two of us.

921
00:58:18,967 --> 00:58:22,419
But let me remind you, he's got
an axe. The man has an axe.

922
00:58:22,554 --> 00:58:26,801
- There'll be four of us in no time.
- Maybe we could sneak away.

923
00:58:26,934 --> 00:58:30,634
You know what I'm thinking,
though. I used to handle...

924
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:34,187
I used to handle an escape
artist named Shandar...

925
00:58:34,316 --> 00:58:41,446
who could get outta ropes, but... the
problem is you gotta be standing up to...

926
00:58:41,573 --> 00:58:46,282
And even then I'm not sure we could
do it. Let me ask you something.

927
00:58:46,411 --> 00:58:50,030
Do you think it's possible we could
work our way off this table?

928
00:58:50,165 --> 00:58:52,786
I can hardly move.

929
00:58:52,918 --> 00:58:55,207
Try with me. I'm serious.

930
00:58:55,337 --> 00:58:59,287
- Try a little bit. Come on, give it a try.
- You're so heavy.

931
00:58:59,424 --> 00:59:04,881
Just try. Just do what I'm telling you.
Come on. It'll happen. Move. Move!

932
00:59:05,013 --> 00:59:06,424
- OK? You all right?
- Yeah.

933
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:09,392
Try and pull. That's it.
See? It's not so tough.

934
00:59:09,518 --> 00:59:11,557
Very good. That's it.

935
00:59:11,687 --> 00:59:13,810
Try and slide down. That's it.

936
00:59:13,939 --> 00:59:16,145
That's it. Very good. Slowly.

937
00:59:16,275 --> 00:59:18,730
That's it. Slowly.
That's it. Come on.

938
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,937
Now pull. Come on. Hard.

939
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:22,814
That's it. That's it.

940
00:59:22,948 --> 00:59:26,151
A little more. I think
we got it. Attagirl.

941
00:59:26,285 --> 00:59:28,610
That's right. OK.

942
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:30,785
- You got it?
- Yeah.

943
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:33,955
Very good. Now, we're...

944
00:59:35,085 --> 00:59:38,501
Here's what... When
Shandar was like this...

945
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:41,382
what he would do is
he would wriggle.

946
00:59:41,508 --> 00:59:43,916
- Wriggle?
- Yeah, and what happens...

947
00:59:44,052 --> 00:59:48,845
is the ropes gradually start to get some
play in them, they start to get loose.

948
00:59:48,974 --> 00:59:52,343
- Take my word for it. He would wriggle.
- You sure?

949
00:59:52,477 --> 00:59:56,392
So, you ready? Ready?
All right, now start to wriggle.

950
00:59:56,523 --> 01:00:00,307
That's right. Wriggle. See what
I mean? That's it. That's a girl.

951
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:03,065
Wriggle. That's it. That's it.

952
01:00:03,196 --> 01:00:06,067
- I'm wriggling.
- Keep wriggling.

953
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:08,655
- Are you wriggling?
- Uh-huh. I'm wriggling.

954
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:12,237
- That's good wriggling.
- I don't wanna over-wriggle.

955
01:00:12,372 --> 01:00:14,579
It's nice wriggling. That's it.

956
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:18,706
The ropes are starting to get loose.
Come on, it's happening.

957
01:00:18,837 --> 01:00:23,001
My hand's getting free.
Keep wriggling. Don't stop now.

958
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:25,209
- I got it, I got it.
- Yeah?

959
01:00:25,344 --> 01:00:28,547
- I got it, I got it.
- Yes?

960
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,218
- Great!
- Come on. Get this thing off.

961
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:35,182
Come on, keep wriggling.
Keep wriggling, darling. Don't...

962
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:37,351
I told you, that's
what Shandar did.

963
01:00:37,481 --> 01:00:42,273
He would wriggle and get the whole thing
to happen. I saw it a million times.

964
01:01:06,176 --> 01:01:08,216
Hey, hey! Hold it!

965
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:35,988
- Let's go. Jesus, where the hell are we?
- God.

966
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:39,289
What is this? This looks like
some kind of a factory.

967
01:01:39,418 --> 01:01:42,621
- It looks like a warehouse.
- Yeah. You hear him?

968
01:01:42,754 --> 01:01:45,589
I think he's right behind us.
Let's get outta here.

969
01:01:45,716 --> 01:01:48,420
- Jeez, it's so dark.
- Don't panic.

970
01:01:48,552 --> 01:01:51,257
- Looks like a lot of parade floats.
- Perfect.

971
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:56,383
There's a guy with a pistol running after
us, we're stuck in the Macy's Day Parade.

972
01:01:56,518 --> 01:02:00,267
- Can you see anyone?
- What's going on? Where the hell are we?

973
01:02:01,356 --> 01:02:02,021
Jesus!

974
01:02:13,201 --> 01:02:15,657
Don't move or I'll
blow your brains out!

975
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:20,248
- Don't shoot! I'm just a beard.
- You're making a mistake.

976
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:24,040
Don't tell me you're the
beard, you goddamn little rat.

977
01:02:24,171 --> 01:02:29,296
Run, Tina, run! He's outta bullets!
It's our chance! It's our chance!

978
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:31,584
All right, I'm coming!

979
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:40,093
You little rat! You're never gonna
get outta here! I'll find you.

980
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:37,405
I don't believe this! He's drunk! I got a
show in a half-hour. I got a packed house.

981
01:03:37,536 --> 01:03:40,656
Don't panic. Don't panic.
I'll deal with him.

982
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:43,410
Relax, will ya?
I can talk to him. Lou...

983
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:46,496
- Is Milton here yet?
- Yes. He came with Howard Cosell.

984
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:49,000
Relax, everybody.
You're gonna be OK.

985
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:53,342
This is Lou's wife, Teresa.
That's Tina... Musante.

986
01:03:53,468 --> 01:03:56,339
- Vitale.
- Danny, he's gotta go on in 20 minutes.

987
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:59,472
I got a full house out there.
Something's gotta happen.

988
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:04,427
Lou, say the three S's. Lou, please,
you gotta pull yourself together.

989
01:04:04,563 --> 01:04:06,852
Listen to me. You're
gonna do a great show.

990
01:04:06,982 --> 01:04:10,102
- He gonna be OK?
- Danny'll get him sober.

991
01:04:10,235 --> 01:04:15,146
Come on, Lou. I need two aspirin, some
tomato juice, some Worcestershire sauce.

992
01:04:15,282 --> 01:04:18,034
And some goat cheese
and some chicken fat.

993
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,449
- That'll do it?
- The Danny Rose formula.

994
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:26,368
- I still can't figure out how it works.
- I promise you're gonna be OK tonight.

Lou, you were wonderfully superb.
"Chicago" is my favourite.

1031
01:06:57,611 --> 01:06:59,650
- I know my fans.
- You were terrific.

1032
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:03,149
- You were worried.
- I wasn't worried. You were fabulous.

1033
01:07:03,283 --> 01:07:05,490
- Thank you for coming.
- Great show.

1034
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:08,288
George, you don't miss an act, huh?

1035
01:07:08,413 --> 01:07:10,821
How you doin', hon?
You holdin' up all right?

1036
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:15,169
Bill and Diane are gonna give me a lift
home. I have to take care of the sitter.

1037
01:07:15,295 --> 01:07:20,041
I'd appreciate it because I gotta
do some serious things with Danny.

1038
01:07:20,175 --> 01:07:24,588
- I'll be home in about two, three hours.
- Danny, make sure he gets home early.

1039
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:27,212
- Lou.
- Eddie! All right!

1040
01:07:29,059 --> 01:07:33,935
Lou, when I tell you what this woman
and I have been through today...

1041
01:07:34,064 --> 01:07:37,314
When you find out what you put me
through today... Unbelievable!

1042
01:07:37,442 --> 01:07:40,278
I gotta speak to you now
while I'm still high.

1043
01:07:40,404 --> 01:07:44,401
He'll fall down when I tell him.
Lou, I can't sleep home tonight.

1044
01:07:44,533 --> 01:07:48,447
I gotta get this off my chest. Tina's
here because she's part of it.

1045
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:50,488
What?

1046
01:07:50,622 --> 01:07:53,327
Come next week, I feel some
changes gotta be made.

1047
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:57,705
- Yeah? Like what?
- Tina and I, we're crazy about each other.

1048
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:00,411
And I feel I gotta say
something to Terry about it.

1049
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:05,092
If that's what you decide on, that's what
you do. If you gotta do it, you gotta do it.

1050
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:09,929
- I just hope you know what you're doing.
- We're sure about a lot of things.

1051
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:12,728
I feel for myself that I gotta
make a few changes.

1052
01:08:12,853 --> 01:08:15,723
- What kind of changes?
- Like management.

1053
01:08:17,357 --> 01:08:19,397
What do you mean, management?

1054
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,436
What do you mean, management?

1055
01:08:22,571 --> 01:08:26,699
Tina's really close to Sid Bacharach.
You had to notice him there tonight.

1056
01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:29,281
He was there to see me.

1057
01:08:32,122 --> 01:08:35,456
I don't understand. You
wanna change management?

1058
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:41,662
Don't think it's not hard for me to say,
but I gotta do what's right for my career.

1059
01:08:43,508 --> 01:08:47,672
What do you mean? Am I hear...?
I can't believe you're saying this.

1060
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:52,763
Danny, Sid can really move me.
I mean, we've got this special rapport.

1061
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:59,479
How do you know Sid? Have you been
pushing him to... to leave me?

1062
01:08:59,608 --> 01:09:04,436
Hey, leave me outta this. All I know is
he's a big talent and he's playin' joints.

1063
01:09:04,571 --> 01:09:06,896
Joints? He was lucky
he could get j...

1064
01:09:07,032 --> 01:09:10,864
When I met him, he was still
singing "Funiculì Funiculà".

1065
01:09:10,994 --> 01:09:15,206
- Look, Danny, facts are facts.
- What are you talking about?

1066
01:09:15,332 --> 01:09:19,033
- This kid owes me his life.
- Leave her outta it. What's done is done.

1067
01:09:19,169 --> 01:09:22,004
I don't understand you, Lou.
We've been through so much.

1068
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:25,416
You make everything into
a personal situation.

1069
01:09:25,551 --> 01:09:29,133
Of course I make it personal.
That's our relationship.

1070
01:09:29,263 --> 01:09:32,513
You can't put into a
contract what I do with you.

1071
01:09:32,641 --> 01:09:35,512
Can I give you...? My uncle
Meyer, the man sold apples...

1072
01:09:35,644 --> 01:09:38,811
- Say somethin'. You know I'm not verbal.
- This is between you.

1073
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:42,889
You gotta do what you gotta do
and Danny's gotta understand it.

1074
01:09:43,026 --> 01:09:47,569
Danny, if anything comes outta this, you
know you're gonna be in for a taste.

1075
01:09:47,698 --> 01:09:53,072
Danny. Where you goin',
Danny? Danny. Danny.

1076
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:03,745
Hey, how you doin', Danny?
You hear about Barney Dunn?

1077
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,626
Couple of guys done a pretty good job
on him. They beat him up pretty badly.

1078
01:10:10,721 --> 01:10:14,765
- I thought he was on a cruise.
- Nah, nah, that was cancelled.

1079
01:10:14,892 --> 01:10:18,011
He's in the hospital now. It
was pretty rough for a while.

1080
01:10:18,145 --> 01:10:21,146
It was touch and go.
But it's all right now.

1081
01:10:21,273 --> 01:10:25,401
The cops got 'em. They got the
guys that done the job on him.

1082
01:10:26,695 --> 01:10:29,151
- Which hospital?
- Roosevelt.

1083
01:11:03,148 --> 01:11:05,188
How you doin', Barney?

1084
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:10,195
Danny. Wh-wh-what
are you doing here?

1085
01:11:11,156 --> 01:11:15,284
Well, I heard that you
got beat up, so...

1086
01:11:16,828 --> 01:11:20,612
I s-s-still don't
know what happened.

1087
01:11:20,749 --> 01:11:24,663
I want you to know if there's
anything I can do, anything at all.

1088
01:11:24,795 --> 01:11:27,831
Hospital bills, anything at
all, I'll take care of it.

1089
01:11:27,965 --> 01:11:30,669
You wanna pay my hospital bills?

1090
01:11:30,801 --> 01:11:33,339
Danny, are you sure <i>you're</i> OK?

1091
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:36,969
Really, Barney, anything at all.
Whatever you need.

1092
01:11:55,742 --> 01:11:58,280
I thought this was a
funny story. It's terrible.

1093
01:11:58,412 --> 01:12:00,654
What do you want me to do?
It's not <i>my</i> life.

1094
01:12:00,789 --> 01:12:04,324
So Lou leaves his wife and kids
and he moves in with Tina.

No. I have a headache.

1102
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,437
What are you giving me?
I ordered a Courvoisier.

1103
01:12:30,569 --> 01:12:34,863
- Didn't you order a Jack Daniels?
- I ordered a Courvoisier.

1104
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:39,533
- You did say Courvoisier.
- Let's not make a federal case out of it.

01:12:44,541 --> 01:12:49,203
- Honey, what are you doin' up?

1106
01:12:49,338 --> 01:12:53,170
- It's four o'clock in the morning.
- Yeah, I know. I had a bad dream.

1107
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:57,463
Is this like a thing or somethin'?
This is goin' on every other night.

1108

- Why don't you take a pill or somethin'?
- I don't like pills.

1109
01:13:00,891 --> 01:13:04,260
When I can't sleep, I take one of
those Seconals. I go out like a baby.

1110
01:13:04,394 --> 01:13:07,977
- I'm OK. I'm fine.
- Listen, I got a great new idea.

1111
01:13:08,106 --> 01:13:13,148
In Atlantic City, I'll open up with
"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You".

1112
01:13:13,278 --> 01:13:15,318
Then I'll go into
"When You're Smiling".

1113
01:13:15,447 --> 01:13:19,231
- Give me a break. It's four in the morning.
- You're not listening to me.

1114
01:13:19,368 --> 01:13:21,360
This is important stuff.

1115
01:13:22,246 --> 01:13:26,374
Angelina, I can't sleep.
I... I feel jumpy.

1116
01:13:27,626 --> 01:13:30,199
I don't know. I'm not myself.

1117
01:13:31,463 --> 01:13:33,919
I see bad dreams.

1118
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,251
Deep dreams. Bad conscience.

1119
01:13:38,387 --> 01:13:42,384
Yeah. A little while
ago I met some man.

1120
01:13:42,516 --> 01:13:44,841
I hardly spent any time with him.

1121
01:13:44,977 --> 01:13:48,143
One day we had an adventure.

1122
01:13:48,272 --> 01:13:51,771
Yes. He makes you feel uneasy.

1123
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:57,143
I did him some... some little wrong.
Just some small business matter.

1124
01:13:57,281 --> 01:13:59,688
I didn't even know him very well.

1125
01:13:59,825 --> 01:14:06,362
When I had the chance to say
something, I... I didn't speak up.

1126
01:14:06,832 --> 01:14:09,619
I have a vision of you...

1127
01:14:09,751 --> 01:14:12,325

01:14:13,046 --> 01:14:15,798
I... I had that dream last week.

1129
01:14:15,924 --> 01:14:18,047
That was it, exactly my dream.

1130
01:14:18,176 --> 01:14:20,846
What is it you're seeking there?

1131
01:14:23,098 --> 01:14:25,636
I wanna rest easy again.

1132
01:14:25,767 --> 01:14:28,223
I wanna find myself.

1133
01:14:29,062 --> 01:14:32,312
I wanna wipe out my thoughts
and forget this guy.

1134
01:14:33,317 --> 01:14:37,266
I can't see clearly. It's unclear.

1135
01:14:37,404 --> 01:14:39,693
It's all unclear.

1136
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:42,610
<i>Non ci vedo bene. Non é chiaro.</i>

1137
01:14:44,328 --> 01:14:47,364
What's the matter with you lately?
You're so edgy.

1138
01:14:47,497 --> 01:14:51,080
I don't wanna go to California, OK?
It gives me the creeps out there.

1139
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:55,753
- It's important you go to California.
- Well, then you go.

1140
01:14:55,881 --> 01:14:59,499
What is it with you? Lately
everything's goin' so nicely.

1141
01:14:59,635 --> 01:15:03,928
My comeback's in full swing now.
But you weren't happy in Vegas.

1142
01:15:04,056 --> 01:15:07,970
You weren't happy in Atlantic City.
I thought you'd be happy.

1143
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:11,138
I'm moody. You knew I was
moody when you met me.

1144
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:15,565
I had it with the moods. I gotta
go to California, that's it.

1145
01:15:15,692 --> 01:15:18,148
Honey, what's the matter?

1146
01:15:19,613 --> 01:15:21,652
I don't know.

1147
01:15:24,868 --> 01:15:26,612
<i>Lou moves to LA.</i>

1148
01:15:26,745 --> 01:15:30,909
<i>Tina doesn't. It's all over between 'em.
Guess who calls her for a date.</i>

1149
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:33,912
- <i>I have no idea.</i>
- <i>Remember the shaving-cream man?</i>

1150
01:15:34,044 --> 01:15:36,167
<i>The guy she met with
Danny in the reeds?</i>

1151
01:15:36,296 --> 01:15:40,164
<i>That's right. They start going out.
But she's just as moody with him.</i>

1152
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:44,345
<i>They fight, they argue. Then one
morning... Thanksgiving morning</i>

1153
01:15:44,471 --> 01:15:46,796
<i>the two of them are
on Central Park West.</i>

1154
01:15:46,932 --> 01:15:48,971
<i>There's the parade.</i>

1155
01:16:44,114 --> 01:16:46,154
- Now what's wrong?
- I don't know.

1156
01:16:46,283 --> 01:16:48,821
Jesus, Tina, what's wrong with you?

1157
01:16:48,952 --> 01:16:53,448
Look, maybe we should have a little
heart-to-heart. Everything makes you cry.

1158
01:16:53,582 --> 01:16:57,033
Maybe you should see a doctor. I don't
know what to do with you. Baby!

1159
01:16:57,169 --> 01:16:59,126
What are you trying to pull here?

1160
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:04,257
- I gotta see Angelina right away.
- I'm sorry. Angelina's not here.

1161
01:17:04,384 --> 01:17:06,922
What time's she coming back?
I need her advice.

1162
01:17:07,054 --> 01:17:10,838
She's with her grandchildren.
She won't be here until Monday.

1163
01:17:10,974 --> 01:17:14,474
- This is important.
- I can't help it if it's important.

1164
01:17:14,603 --> 01:17:18,303
She won't be here until Monday.
Please come Monday.

1165
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:37,245
OK, I got the frozen turkeys!

1166
01:17:39,836 --> 01:17:43,170
- Thank you, Danny.
- Give me a little hand. God love you.

1167
01:17:43,298 --> 01:17:45,920
- Here's your frozen turkey.
- Thank you.

1168
01:17:46,051 --> 01:17:50,096
B- B-Believe me, the frozen is
just as g-good as the r-real.

1169
01:17:50,222 --> 01:17:51,550
- Got it?
- Uh-huh.

1170
01:17:51,682 --> 01:17:54,089
The frozens are much cheaper
than the real ones.

1171
01:17:54,226 --> 01:17:58,224
- Can I help?
- No, sit there. You'll fall over.

1172
01:17:58,355 --> 01:18:01,024
Just dig in, dig in.
Don't hesitate.

1173
01:18:02,067 --> 01:18:04,523
- This is really great.
- Would you like a drink?

1174
01:18:04,653 --> 01:18:06,859
I'd love it.

1175
01:18:06,989 --> 01:18:10,571
There's some Tab and
some club soda.

1176
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:13,405
Give her some Coke.
Excuse me one second.

1177
01:18:13,537 --> 01:18:17,072
Hello? Yeah, sure.
We're... That's right.

1178
01:18:17,207 --> 01:18:20,244
It's the twins.
It's the twins. They're...

1179
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:24,085
Sure, darling. Sure.

1180
01:18:24,214 --> 01:18:27,879
And the new noses are good?
Yes. Sure.

1181
01:18:34,182 --> 01:18:36,638
I... I came to apologise.

1182
01:18:42,441 --> 01:18:45,192
You gonna ask me in?

1183
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:47,810
Let me call you back. Yeah.

1184
01:18:47,946 --> 01:18:51,647
I'll get back to you. Let me
call you. I'll call you back.

1185
01:18:54,286 --> 01:18:56,741
Hope I'm not intruding.

1186
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:05,577
- I realise you hate me.
- Bring her in. The food's gettin' cold.

1187
01:19:05,714 --> 01:19:08,335
D- D-Danny,
who's your fr-fr-fr... guest?

1188
01:19:09,426 --> 01:19:12,095
Oh, it's nobody. It's nothing.

1189
01:19:14,306 --> 01:19:19,680
Was it your uncle Sidney who said
"acceptance, forgiveness and love"?

1190
01:19:19,811 --> 01:19:21,934
Look, I've had a bad year.

1191
01:19:22,064 --> 01:19:27,022
If things don't pick up for me, I'm
gonna be selling storm windows soon.

1192
01:19:28,487 --> 01:19:31,357
I'd like to be friends.

1193
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:35,073
I don't think that would
be such a great idea.

1194
01:19:35,202 --> 01:19:38,618
This is the best Thanksgiving
party we've had so far!

1195
01:19:38,747 --> 01:19:40,823
Here's your napkin, honey.

1196
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,449
This is absolutely the
best Thanksgiving party.

1197
01:19:43,585 --> 01:19:47,203
- Danny, this is marvellous.
- Danny, who's your fr-fr-fr... guest?

1198
01:19:47,339 --> 01:19:51,882
- The cranberry sauce is dry.
- You're eating the mashed potatoes.

1199
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,175
Hey, what a spread!

1200
01:19:56,306 --> 01:20:01,182
Gloria, wait a second. Hey, Danny,
thanks a lot for the invite.

1201
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:04,396
Thanksgiving sure
rolls around fast.

1202
01:21:03,332 --> 01:21:07,376
<i>- Well, that's my Danny Rose story.
- Unbelievable.</i>

1203
01:21:07,502 --> 01:21:11,251
<i>The man is a living legend. Do you
know that only six months ago...</i>

1204
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:14,881
<i>they gave him the greatest honour
you can get in the Broadway area?</i>

1205
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:19,257
<i>Look at the menu. At this delicatessen
they named a sandwich after him.</i>

1206
01:21:19,389 --> 01:21:21,762
<i>The Danny Rose Special.</i>

1207
01:21:21,892 --> 01:21:25,225
<i>Probably a cream cheese on a
bagel with marinara sauce.</i>

1208
01:21:25,354 --> 01:21:27,062
<i>He deserves it.</i>

1209
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:29,976
<i>Did you ever go to one of
his Thanksgiving parties?</i>

1210
01:21:30,108 --> 01:21:31,271
<i>One party.</i>

1211
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:34,272
<i>Where they have the frozen turkey.</i>

1212
01:21:34,404 --> 01:21:38,319
- <i>Economical, but a lot of laughs.</i>
- <i>Cranberry sauce made like a rocket.</i>

1213
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:40,988
- <i>You had to de-thaw the corn.</i>
- <i>It was incredible.</i>

1214
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:46,624
<i>Listen, excuse me. Before we go any
further, may I ask you a favour?</i>

1215
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:49,075
<i>Can we go home now? I'm tired.</i>

1216
01:21:49,211 --> 01:21:50,373
<i>We're having laughs.</i>

1217
01:21:50,504 --> 01:21:52,081
<i>I haven't seen you in 110 years.</i>

1218
01:21:52,214 --> 01:21:53,922
<i>I'm going to Atlantic
City tomorrow.</i>

1219
01:21:54,049 --> 01:21:57,216
<i>- I'll get the check. I'll take care of it.
- Really?</i>

1220
01:21:57,344 --> 01:22:00,678
<i>National holiday.
Corbett has the check.</i>

1221
01:22:00,806 --> 01:22:03,475
<i>For these kind of laughs,
I figure it's worth it.</i>

1222
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,759
<i>Well, we'll do it again tomorrow.</i>

1223
01:24:13,647 --> 01:24:16,731
