1
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:05,356
On December 1, 1935...

2
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:09,095
Mrs. William Starkwell,
the wife of a New Jersey handyman...

3
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:12,065
...gives birth to her first and only child.

4
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:15,168
It is a boy, and they name it Virgil.

5
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:19,039
He is an exceptionally cute baby,
with a sweet disposition.

6
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:24,277
Before he is 25 years old,
he will be wanted by police in six states...

7
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:29,516
...for assault, armed robbery,
and illegal possession of a wart.

8
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:31,284
Growing up in a slum neighborhood...

9
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:34,955
...where the crime rate is amongst
the highest in the nation is not easy.

10
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:41,685
Particularly for Virgil, who is small and frail
compared to the other children.

11
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:11,791
Virgil Starkwell attends this school
where he scores well on an IQ test...

12
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:15,562
...although his behavior
disturbs the teachers.

13
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:20,333
We interviewed Mrs. Dorothy Lowry,
a school teacher who remembered Virgil.

14
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:24,173
I remember one time,
he stole a fountain pen.

15
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:26,673
I didn't want to embarrass him.

16
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:29,075
You know, teachers have
ways of doing things...

17
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:33,613
...so I said to the class,
'We will all close our eyes...

18
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:37,384
'and will the one who took
the pen please return it?'

19
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:39,975
While our eyes were closed...

20
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:42,353
...he returned the pen.

21
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:47,209
But he took the opportunity
of feeling all the girls.

22
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:51,696
Can I say 'feel'?

23
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:58,713
Spending most of his time in the streets,
Virgil takes to crime at an early age.

24
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,974
He is an immediate failure.

25
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:06,854
He barely manages to escape
with a gumball machine stuck on his hand.

26
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:10,950
With both parents working
to make ends meet...

27
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,354
Virgil becomes closest to his grandfather...

28
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:16,489
...a 60-year-old German immigrant...

29
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:19,626
...who takes the boy to movies
and baseball games.

30
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:21,726
Then tragedy strikes.

31
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:23,263
At a Washington Senators' game...

32
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:27,367
Virgil's grandfather is struck
in the head by a foul ball.

33
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,136
The blow causes
permanent injury to his mind...

34
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:32,939
...and he becomes convinced
he is Kaiser Wilhelm.

35
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:39,669
Here are some rare photos of him with
other patients on the sanitarium grounds.

36
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:44,258
When he is 15 years old,
amidst the violence...

37
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:46,086
...and poverty of the slums...

38
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:49,076
Virgil receives a cello as a gift.

39
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:54,160
He is fascinated by the instrument...

40
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,700
...and for the first time
in the Starkwell house, music is heard.

41
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:10,643
We spoke to Mr. Torgman,
his first and only cello teacher.

42
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:13,379
There is not very much to tell...

43
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,474
...because his cello
playing was just terrible.

44
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:20,086
He would...

45
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:23,331
He had no idea about tone production.

46
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:27,018
He would just saw it back and forth...

47
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:31,492
...just scratch the
instrument to such a point...

48
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,535
...it would drive everyone who listened to it
absolutely insane.

49
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:38,671
He had no conception of the instrument.

50
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,771
He was blowing into it.

51
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:49,247
He loved his cello.

52
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:52,452
And I think he stole to pay for his lessons...

53
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:56,207
...but he would not apply himself one iota.

54
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,194
Virgil steals to pay for cello lessons...

55
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:04,230
...and although he does not achieve
greatness on the instrument...

56
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,495
...he is soon good enough
to play in a local band.

57
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:39,465
A jungle, however, is no place for a cellist...

58
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:43,305
...and Virgil soon learns the facts of life.

59
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:08,962
At 18, Virgil is lonely and confused.

60
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:13,266
Unable to concentrate in school,
he has long since dropped out.

61
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:17,437
He wants nothing more than to belong,
if only to a street gang.

62
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:21,617
It is here, he thinks,
he will prove his manhood.

63
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:27,647
Under constant economic pressure...

64
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:31,851
Virgil turns to the local pool hall
as a means of making a living.

65
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:36,541
'I'm going to be a pool hustler,'
he tells his friends.

66
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:39,859
Ball, please.

67
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,959
Okay, thanks.

68
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:13,159
Virgil tries to join the navy
but is psychologically unfit.

69
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,299
That looks to me like...

70
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,495
...two elephants...

71
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,590
...making love to a men's glee club.

72
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:26,472
Mr. T.S. Foster, Virgil's first
probation officer, remembers him vividly.

73
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:29,175
He was a trustworthy kind of person.

74
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:32,712
You had to remember
certain idiosyncrasies that he had.

75
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,812
Like what?

76
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:40,407
Like not always telling the truth.

77
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,240
He didn't always tell the truth.

78
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,157
Sometimes, he exaggerated the truth.

79
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:52,762
Sometimes, you know, he just plain lies.

80
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:55,601
He does have a criminal record, yes...

81
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:58,638
...but that doesn't mean
that the boy was all bad.

82
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:01,741
Unable to fit in
with any aspect of his environment...

83
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:04,391
Virgil strikes out on his own.

84
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:40,500
In an effort to shed some light
on this period of his life...

85
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,702
...we spoke with his father and mother.

86
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:47,106
They are ashamed of their son's
criminal record and so wear disguises.

87
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:48,975
He was a good boy.

88
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:53,212
Come on, if he was a good boy,
why are we wearing these?

89
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:55,548
He's rotten, he's a gangster.

90
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:59,952
How can you say that?
He was so bright and he was so talented.

91
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:02,188
What 'bright and talented'?
- He loved music.

92
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:05,057
He was an atheist.
- He could've been a musician.

93
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:08,594
I tried to beat God into him
but it was too tough.

94
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:12,999
He was trying to get away from us,
and be independent, make his own life.

95
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:16,569
Be a human being on his own.
I mean, you're a very dominating person.

96
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:19,906
What?
- You are, and he was trying to find himself.

97
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:21,073
Me? I'm...
- Yes.

98
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:25,077
I'll talk to you later about the whole thing.
- What do you mean, 'later'?

99
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:27,713
Vowing that he will never serve
his full term...

100
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:34,103
Virgil plans an elaborate escape,
using a bar of soap and some shoe polish.

101
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:48,891
Guard.

102
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:52,569
Yeah?

103
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:54,707
You got to take me to the infirmary.

104
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:57,357
What's the matter?
- Don't ask.

105
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,447
Virgil's attempted escape
is dealt with harshly.

106
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:37,516
His sentence is extended
an additional two years.

107
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:41,441
1956 is a happy-go-lucky year
for most people.

108
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:05,544
Virgil sees none of it from his tiny cell.

109
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:07,647
He marks time by reading.

110
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:10,683
Until one day, a new opportunity arises.

111
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:13,928
We need volunteers for an experiment.

112
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:19,753
The doctors want someone
to be inoculated with a new vaccine.

113
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,261
It's never been tried on humans before...

114
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:26,441
...so we don't know what
the side effects may be.

115
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,199
To be honest...

116
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,766
...you'll be taking a chance.

117
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:35,267
As reward, there's a parole.

118
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:40,579
I'm sure there are some among you
brave enough to take the risk.

119
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,950
With parole as inducement,
Virgil submits to the vaccine test.

120
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,021
It is a success,
except for one temporary side effect.

121
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:51,791
For several hours, he is turned into a rabbi.

122
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:55,850
And so, the reason we celebrate...

123
00:12:55,928 --> 00:13:00,228
...the Passover holidays
by eating the matzo...

124
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:03,069
...is to commemorate the time...

125
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:07,105
...that Moses led the children of Israel...

126
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
...from Egypt.

127
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:26,192
He has so many good qualities. I mean...

128
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:27,960
Yeah, name 'em.

129
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,364
He had all sorts of mechanical abilities,
he was artistic.

130
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:35,034
Remember the painting
he did for you on your birthday?

131
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:36,969
A no-good atheist was what he was.

132
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:40,372
I used to hit him
and try to teach him about God...

133
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,141
...but would he listen? No.

134
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:44,944
Virgil leaves prison, apprehensive...

135
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:48,214
...but with some hope
that he can begin a new life.

136
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:51,650
Instead, he finds a world
difficult to cope with.

137
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,765
Ashamed to go home,
he rents a cheap room in a strange city.

138
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,348
Desperate and broke...

139
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:32,852
Virgil tries to support himself
with small crimes.

140
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:36,522
Here, he attempts to rob a local pet shop.

141
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:26,891
I hope you haven't been watching me.
I'm not very good.

142
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,509
I was strolling down here just now...

143
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:33,612
...and I noticed that you were drawing
something and I thought...

144
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:35,714
You can look at it if you want to.
- Can I?

145
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:37,650
It's not very good.

146
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,948
I wouldn't say that.
I think that it's wonderful.

147
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:46,623
It's not very good.

148
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,628
I think that it's very good, actually.

149
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:52,364
I think you could probably make cash.

150
00:16:52,464 --> 00:16:55,834
Are you an artist?
- No, of course I'm not.

151
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:57,934
I'm not an artist.

152
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:00,272
What do you do?

153
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:02,372
I'm a laundress.

154
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:06,145
Laundry?

155
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:10,545
Yeah, I wash clothes, primarily.

156
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:12,818
That's great.

157
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:14,420
No, it isn't.

158
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,957
I like it, but it's not particularly interesting.

159
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,267
What's your name?
- Louise.

160
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:24,653
What's yours?
- Virgil Starkwell.

161
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,231
What do you do?

162
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,458
What do I do?

163
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:33,472
I play the cello.

164
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:36,802
That's fantastic.
- Yes, I'm a cellist.

165
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:40,212
It's a wonderful job.
- Are you with the Philharmonic?

166
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:42,815
Yes, I am, actually.
- That's fantastic.

167
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:45,017
Yes, I'm with the Philharmonic group.

168
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:47,176
Quite a good group.

169
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:51,481
I dress like this
because I'm just off work now.

170
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:57,196
Can I interest you in going for a walk at all?
- Okay.

171
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:00,297
I know I was in love.

172
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:02,334
First of all, I was very nauseous.

173
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:06,739
I had never met such a pretty girl,
and I guess I'm sensitive...

174
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,579
...because real beauty
makes me want to gag.

175
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,945
Plus, I don't know how to act with girls.

176
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:15,514
You know, I'm shy
and I'm just nervous around women.

177
00:18:15,614 --> 00:18:18,079
I have a tendency to dribble.

178
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:24,189
The only girl that I had known
was a girl in my neighborhood...

179
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:25,791
...and was not an attractive girl.

180
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:29,728
I used to make
obscene phone calls to her collect...

181
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:34,166
...and she used to accept the charges
all the time, but nothing ever happened.

182
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:36,368
And here I am lying through my teeth.

183
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:40,165
I can't tell Louise that I was in jail...

184
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:44,343
...and that I rob and steal, and never did
an honest day's work in my life.

185
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:47,346
A lot of people
hold those things against you.

186
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:50,416
She was so sweet.
We just walked in the park...

187
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:52,484
...and I was so touched by her that...

188
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:55,287
...after 15 minutes, I wanted to marry her.

189
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:59,558
And after a half hour, I completely
gave up the idea of snatching her purse.

190
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:02,728
I wanted to tell her
that I wasn't with the Philharmonic...

191
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:05,130
...but she was so impressed by it.

192
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,133
Once, she asked me
some questions about Mozart...

193
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:12,371
...and she got suspicious because,
for a minute, I couldn't place the name.

194
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:14,440
I don't know, when it comes to women...

195
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,445
In prison, I remember the psychiatrist
asked me if I had a girl, and I said, 'No.'

196
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:22,648
And he said, do I think that sex is dirty...

197
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:25,517
...and I said, 'It is, if you're doing it right.'

198
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:27,820
All I know is,
my heart was really pounding...

199
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,170
...and I felt... I felt a funny tingling all over.

200
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:36,091
I was either in love, or I had smallpox.

201
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:50,718
You wanna have dinner tonight?
- Sure.

202
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:31,436
You're very beautiful. I really mean that.

203
00:22:31,536 --> 00:22:34,766
Does it embarrass you when I say that?

204
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:37,643
It does.

205
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:39,743
That's a pretty hat.

206
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:41,913
Thank you.

207
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:44,383
I see them all over town.
- Do you?

208
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:47,203
You know, feather and the white.

209
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:51,790
I haven't seen many.
- They're on sale downtown.

210
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,860
I passed them as I was walking
around the streets.

211
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,890
There are millions of them.
You know, in one of those bins.

212
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:02,098
Is that so?

213
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:05,999
I could watch you eat all night.

214
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:10,173
But why?
- I don't know.

215
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:14,307
You're so pretty when you...

216
00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:30,962
After dinner, we went for a walk.

217
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:34,037
I asked her for a lock of her hair.

218
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:37,703
We didn't have a scissor,
so I tried pulling it out.

219
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:39,471
She was a good sport, I tell you.

220
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:42,631
When she got excited, she stuttered.

221
00:23:43,341 --> 00:23:46,812
I think she was so cute that way.
I like a girl who stutters.

222
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:49,781
They turn red,
they're always gasping for breath.

223
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:52,091
It's really sweet looking.

224
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:56,355
She was an expert on laundry.
She was fantastic.

225
00:23:56,455 --> 00:24:00,692
I offered to let her do my shorts,
and she was very moved by that, I think.

226
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,361
She knew everything about underwear.

227
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:05,597
I never saw anybody who knew
so much about socks and T-shirts.

228
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:08,842
She was some kind of genius that way.

229
00:24:21,713 --> 00:24:25,205
Good night, Virgil.

230
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:35,727
Continuing his deception,
Virgil sees Louise more frequently.

231
00:24:35,827 --> 00:24:41,500
When she questions him about
his cello playing, he avoids the subject.

232
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,172
In order to better understand Louise,
let us examine her background briefly.

233
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:50,642
Adopted at age two
from a cruel and impoverished orphanage...

234
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:53,378
...by a career military man and his wife...

235
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:56,548
...she was subjected to an upbringing
of extreme discipline...

236
00:24:56,648 --> 00:24:59,251
...which left her shy and withdrawn.

237
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:02,721
Never having a real home,
she lived on army bases...

238
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:05,690
...while her father pursued
a brilliant military career...

239
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,961
...that after 30 years catapulted him
to the rank of corporal.

240
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:13,532
Her mother, an alcoholic,
turns to religion for comfort...

241
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:15,534
...and quickly becomes a fanatic.

242
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:19,304
She responds to Louise's need for love
by beating the child...

243
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:21,873
...and claims to have
conversations with God...

244
00:25:21,973 --> 00:25:26,903
...in which they discuss salvation
and interior decorating.

245
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:33,708
Destitute and in love, Virgil attempts
to change his life with one bold stroke.

246
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:51,203
And if you'll just take this to Window 9.

247
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:53,303
Thank you.

248
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:01,344
What does this say?

249
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:04,749
Can't you read that?

250
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:08,759
I can't read this. What's this, 'act natural'?

251
00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:13,425
It says, 'Please put $50,000
into this bag and act natural.'

252
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:15,735
It does say 'act natural.'

253
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:19,389
'I am pointing a gun at you.'

254
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,802
That looks like 'gub,'
that doesn't look like 'gun.'

255
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:27,005
No, it's 'gun.'
- No, that's 'gub.' That's a 'b.'

256
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:30,845
No, that's an 'n.' It's G-U-N. That's 'gun.'

257
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:35,447
George, would you step
over here a moment, please?

258
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:37,547
What does this say?

259
00:26:38,883 --> 00:26:41,909
'Please put $50,000...

260
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,322
'into this bag and abt natural.'

261
00:26:44,422 --> 00:26:46,358
What's 'abt'?
- It's 'act.'

262
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:49,586
Does this look like 'gub' or 'gun'?

263
00:26:51,162 --> 00:26:53,627
'Gun.' But what's 'abt' mean?

264
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:55,467
It's 'act.' A-C-T.'Act natural.'

265
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:59,817
'Please put $50,000
into this bag and act natural.'

266
00:27:00,972 --> 00:27:03,607
I see. This is a hold-up.
- Yes.

267
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:05,975
May I see your gun?

268
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:13,818
You'll have to have this note
initialed by a vice president...

269
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:16,454
...before I can give you any money.

270
00:27:16,554 --> 00:27:17,789
I'm in a rush.

271
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:19,457
What?
- I'm in a rush.

272
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:22,362
I'm sorry, but that's our policy.

273
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,665
The gentleman in the gray suit.

274
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,637
That's G-U-N.'I am pointing a gun at you.'
- But that's a 'b.' That's 'gub.'

275
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:33,838
That's G-U-N.

276
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:36,875
That's a 'b'. That's 'gub.'
- No, excuse me, that's 'n.'

277
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:38,076
Miss Frank.

278
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:41,942
'I am pointing a gun at you, abt natural.'

279
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:43,882
What is 'abt'?
- No, that's 'act.'

280
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:46,151
It couldn't be. That's a plain 'b.'

281
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:50,021
No, I'm afraid not. That's 'act natural'
and 'I'm pointing a gun at you.'

282
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:51,222
Mr. Miller.

283
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:54,348
'I am pointing a gub...'

284
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,561
No, that's 'gun.' That's G-U-N...

285
00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:59,264
That's 'gun.' 'I am pointing a gun at you.'

286
00:27:59,364 --> 00:28:02,509
It looks like a 'b,' but it's an 'n.'

287
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:07,493
Of course it is. That's 'gub.'
- No, it isn't.

288
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:09,874
It couldn't be.
- It has to be.

289
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:13,714
We discussed this inside, a short while ago.

290
00:28:20,552 --> 00:28:22,552
Hello, Louise?

291
00:28:22,987 --> 00:28:24,856
Listen, I can't make our date today.

292
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:27,926
I've got to go up to Boston
to give a concert.

293
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:31,341
Why don't I give you a call in about...

294
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:33,663
About 10 years.

295
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,509
Virgil Starkwell is apprehended
in the act of bank robbery.

296
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:49,514
He is given 10 years at the state's
strictest maximum-security prison.

297
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:55,479
It is here that he mingles
with hardened criminals for the first time.

298
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:05,397
'A prison has not been built
that can hold me...'

299
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:08,500
Virgil tells another inmate,
'And I'll get out of this one...

300
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,255
'if it means spending my entire life here.'

301
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:30,455
After all, what a child becomes
is according to what his environment is...

302
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:33,958
...what his background is.
Let's face it, it was our fault.

303
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:36,394
Would you let a man say a word or two?

304
00:29:36,494 --> 00:29:40,665
I knew. There was a day when I said,
'This kid is rotten.'

305
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:43,968
You know the expression 'a rotten kid'?
That's what this kid is.

306
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:46,137
I knew when he was...
- Whose genes did he have?

307
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:48,540
What genes?
- And chromosomes?

308
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,476
What? Don't talk fancy in front of the man...

309
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:55,346
...because, you know,
you'll make an impression...

310
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:57,549
The time passes slowly for Virgil...

311
00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:00,919
...who works hard
and tries to adjust to prison life.

312
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:06,204
He becomes a model prisoner
and is put to work in the laundry.

313
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:36,211
Visitor, Starkwell.
- For me?

314
00:31:54,532 --> 00:31:57,082
I'm not with the Philharmonic.

315
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,169
I know.

316
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:03,403
I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Virgil.

317
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:06,511
You don't mind that I came
to see you, do you?

318
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:09,171
No, I'm happy to see you.

319
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:11,883
God, how'd you find out I was here?

320
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:13,952
I called up your landlady.

321
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:17,707
She told me where you were.
She said that...

322
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,890
Did you rob a bank?

323
00:32:21,793 --> 00:32:23,328
I did not rob a bank.

324
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:25,930
If I had robbed a bank,
everything would be great.

325
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,074
What did you do?

326
00:32:27,174 --> 00:32:30,134
I tried to rob a bank, that's what happened.

327
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:33,549
And they got me. I misspelled the note.

328
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:39,308
Can you bake?

329
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:41,980
Yeah?

330
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,605
I need a cake.

331
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:48,219
A big cake, like a chocolate layer cake.

332
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,622
You're allergic to chocolate.

333
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:52,857
I need a cake with a gun in it.

334
00:32:52,957 --> 00:32:55,360
I'll bake you a cake
but I won't put the gun in.

335
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,398
Then I'd like about a dozen...

336
00:32:57,498 --> 00:33:00,431
...chocolate-chip cookies
with a bullet in each.

337
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:03,234
How long are you going to be here?

338
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:05,334
Well...

339
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,730
I estimate in the neighborhood of...

340
00:33:10,141 --> 00:33:12,141
What's today, Monday?

341
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,195
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday...
Ten years.

342
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:23,121
Is it possible that you could wait for me?

343
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,221
Yes. If you want me to.

344
00:33:27,725 --> 00:33:29,727
With Louise to inspire him...

345
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:33,398
Virgil works hard
and becomes more optimistic.

346
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:37,238
She comes frequently
for the next few months.

347
00:33:39,303 --> 00:33:44,828
He complains about the food,
and she brings him home-cooked meals.

348
00:33:52,116 --> 00:33:56,421
Louise's impact on Virgil
is discussed here by Dr. Julius Epstein...

349
00:33:56,521 --> 00:34:00,325
...one-time prison psychiatrist
who recalls Virgil.

350
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:02,260
Louise meant a great deal to Virgil.

351
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,762
From a psychiatric point of view...

352
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:08,099
...his love for her
was the healthiest thing in his life.

353
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,565
It was genuine and clean.

354
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:13,919
Not like some patients I know.

355
00:34:14,806 --> 00:34:16,741
She ain't gonna wait, Virgil.

356
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:20,156
They think they can, but they never do.

357
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:23,314
You know, I become eligible for parole
in a year and a half.

358
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:24,983
Yeah? That's nice.

359
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,286
With any luck, in maybe two or three years,
you'll get out of here?

360
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:30,596
It could be a lot shorter.

361
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:32,523
What do you mean?

362
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:36,561
He means we got this proposition
we wanna talk over with you.

363
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:38,262
What kind of proposition?

364
00:34:38,362 --> 00:34:41,232
Like next week, five of us
are gonna make it out of here.

365
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:43,391
We need an extra man.

366
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:47,572
It's all set. By next week,
we could be miles away from this zoo.

367
00:34:47,672 --> 00:34:52,110
You guys have got to be kidding.
We'd never get out of here, they'd kill us.

368
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,948
We got out of rougher places than this.
- Why don't you just think about it?

369
00:34:57,048 --> 00:35:00,051
Ain't no broad gonna wait around
for years for you.

370
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:04,401
No matter what she tells you
in that visiting hall.

371
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:09,093
I think the conflict
in this personality disorder...

372
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:12,163
...sort of started from his formative years.

373
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:16,200
I think that it gave evidence
in his choice of the cello, for instance.

374
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,669
Studying the cello at the age of six.

375
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:23,007
He was coming out of the formative years,
but the conflict is there within the choice...

376
00:35:23,107 --> 00:35:26,844
...because it's generally assumed
that the cello is a phallic symbol.

377
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:29,174
I mean, with the grasp...

378
00:35:29,347 --> 00:35:33,251
But the lower structural form
is certainly feminine...

379
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:35,901
...and, if anything, motherly.

380
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:40,877
In fact, the utilization of the bow,
I would imagine...

381
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:44,695
...is the sublimation of stroking a torso.

382
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:48,399
So, between the grasping of the phallic...

383
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:50,369
...and the stroking of
the torso would create,

384
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:51,469
I would imagine...

385
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:55,054
...great conflict even at the age of six.

386
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:07,351
Virgil Starkwell becomes part
of an escape plot.

387
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:11,021
His every move becomes
tense and strained.

388
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:50,094
...take the guards on our floor with us,
so be ready if there's trouble.

389
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:52,864
I don't understand
how we're gonna get past the main tower.

390
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:55,099
We're gonna be dressed as guards.

391
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,336
That's why Friday at noon,
because you work in the laundry...

392
00:36:58,436 --> 00:37:00,706
...you're gonna steal
the guard's underwear.

393
00:37:00,806 --> 00:37:01,806
What?

394
00:37:01,906 --> 00:37:04,442
We already got some uniforms
stashed in a dark room.

395
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:07,778
I don't understand.
Why do you need the underwear?

396
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:10,314
We want to do this
as realistically as possible.

397
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:13,049
I'm known for my detailed work.

398
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:19,688
Forward in twos.

399
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:58,196
Sir, we can't find our underwear.
- I think something's up.

400
00:37:58,296 --> 00:38:00,761
We better keep our eyes open.

401
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:05,436
The warden knows something is up.
Better call off the break.

402
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:07,104
What?

403
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:11,075
I said the warden knows something's up,
we better call off the break.

404
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:12,543
It's all set for tonight.

405
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:15,958
It's too risky. We can't take a chance.

406
00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:21,425
Tell Virgil. I'll tell the rest of these guys.

407
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:30,551
The break's off. The Warden knows
something's up. We'll try it again next week.

408
00:38:33,764 --> 00:38:35,399
The Warden wants to see you.

409
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,499
What for?
- Come on.

410
00:38:42,273 --> 00:38:45,876
Michael Sullivan, an ex-convict
and one of the leaders of the break...

411
00:38:45,976 --> 00:38:48,212
...describes that fateful day.

412
00:38:48,312 --> 00:38:51,349
I told all the other guys
that the break was off...

413
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:54,084
...but I forgot to tell Virgil.

414
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:56,895
I don't know why I forgot.

415
00:38:57,988 --> 00:38:59,988
Nobody ever told him.

416
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:10,290
All ready.
- What?

417
00:40:07,892 --> 00:40:13,842
There's a break in the north cell block.
Notify the warden immediately.

418
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:27,109
Where is everybody?

419
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:29,914
We've called the break off.

420
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:32,283
You called the break off?
- Yeah.

421
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:34,051
Why didn't somebody tell me?

422
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:37,018
Virgil's out there by himself.

423
00:40:41,425 --> 00:40:44,853
Could somebody possibly
sneak downstairs...

424
00:40:44,953 --> 00:40:46,953
...and let me back in?

425
00:41:11,288 --> 00:41:16,327
All right, Warden, I got your daughter.
- Please hold your fire, men.

426
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:18,362
Let me go, or she gets it.

427
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:20,927
What is she doing down there?

428
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:23,563
She was kissing Kowalski.

429
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:27,829
Is Kowalski a midget?
- No.

430
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:30,474
He's not a midget.
- What'd he say?

431
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:32,574
He's not a midget.

432
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:54,732
Can I have a taxi, please?
- First one in line's next.

433
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:43,147
On July 11th, Virgil and Louise marry.

434
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:46,283
It is a simple ceremony,
following what he later described...

435
00:42:46,383 --> 00:42:49,188
...as a deeply moving blood test.

436
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,889
This was the happiest moment of my life.

437
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:54,124
I just wish my parents
could have been there.

438
00:42:54,224 --> 00:42:55,593
We weren't aware of it.

439
00:42:55,693 --> 00:42:58,243
Am I right? Say it, be honest.

440
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:02,060
He turned out to be a punk.

441
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:05,169
They take up residence in another state...

442
00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:07,805
...and living on Louise's small savings...

443
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:10,574
...they move into a cheaply furnished flat.

444
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:15,079
They are poor, but for the moment at least,
safe from the law.

445
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:17,314
When these innocent pictures were taken...

446
00:43:17,414 --> 00:43:20,518
...they were both unaware
of the incredible series of events...

447
00:43:20,618 --> 00:43:22,618
...that were to come.

448
00:45:09,093 --> 00:45:13,063
What's the matter, Virgil?
- I got a cramp in the arch of my foot.

449
00:45:13,163 --> 00:45:14,198
What?

450
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:16,967
A little hard ball came out
in the arch of my foot.

451
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:20,104
Why does that always happen
every time we make love?

452
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:22,204
Jesus.

453
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:27,244
As a wanted criminal, Virgil finds it
harder than ever to find employment.

454
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:30,914
He secures a little work,
selling encyclopedias door-to-door...

455
00:45:31,014 --> 00:45:34,329
...but the job proves too much for him.

456
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:36,787
He is forced to take to the streets...

457
00:45:36,887 --> 00:45:41,902
...and for a while he earns a meager living
selling meagers.

458
00:45:43,527 --> 00:45:45,822
We're going to have a baby.

459
00:45:47,531 --> 00:45:51,035
Get out of here.
- No, we're going to have a baby.

460
00:45:51,135 --> 00:45:54,038
I went to the doctor.
We're going to have a baby.

461
00:45:54,138 --> 00:45:56,858
That's my present for Christmas.

462
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:01,104
All I needed was a tie.

463
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,780
Aren't you happy?

464
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:07,785
I don't believe it.
- Virgil, really.

465
00:46:07,885 --> 00:46:09,885
How did it happen?

466
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:13,147
What do you mean, how did it happen?

467
00:46:13,657 --> 00:46:15,657
You mean because...

468
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,591
...of that night when the two of us...

469
00:46:22,399 --> 00:46:24,524
And that's what happened?

470
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:29,273
In the spring, Virgil and Louise
are blessed with a son.

471
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:34,898
They name the boy Jonathan Ralph
Starkwell, after Virgil's mother.

472
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:56,400
Virgil and Louise move to a new state
and try to start over.

473
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,303
Virgil has the usual trouble finding work.

474
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:01,939
Finally he hears of an opening
in an insurance office...

475
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:04,041
...and, his back against the wall...

476
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:07,796
...he attempts to lie his way into the job.

477
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:13,281
Please sit down.

478
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:20,355
Name, please?

479
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:23,325
John Q. Public.

480
00:47:24,228 --> 00:47:26,228
That's P-U-B-L-l-C.

481
00:47:27,497 --> 00:47:32,603
Mr. Public, have you had any experience
working in an office before?

482
00:47:32,703 --> 00:47:34,703
Yes, I have.

483
00:47:35,205 --> 00:47:37,500
What kind of office was it?

484
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:40,275
Rectangular.

485
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,014
Have you ever had
any experience in running...

486
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:47,854
...a high-speed digital-electronic computer?

487
00:47:48,385 --> 00:47:50,385
Yes, I have.

488
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:53,321
Where?

489
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,625
My aunt has one.

490
00:47:56,727 --> 00:47:59,022
And what does your aunt do?

491
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:01,963
I can't recall.

492
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:04,768
You said before you worked in an office.

493
00:48:04,868 --> 00:48:08,948
Did you deal in products or services?
- Products.

494
00:48:09,673 --> 00:48:12,309
Is this something found in the home?

495
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:16,064
No, it's not. It's one down and nine to go.

496
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:18,146
Is this product edible?

497
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:20,340
No, I'm afraid it wasn't.

498
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:23,287
I think our time has run out...

499
00:48:23,387 --> 00:48:25,923
...and I'm sorry to say
you haven't guessed my occupation.

500
00:48:26,023 --> 00:48:29,159
So, I'm going to flip all the cards
and tell you what I used to do.

501
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:31,628
I used to manufacture escalator shoes...

502
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:34,765
...for people who were nauseous
in elevator shoes.

503
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:38,202
I'm sorry you didn't actually
get my occupation...

504
00:48:38,302 --> 00:48:40,361
...but you did win $10.

505
00:48:40,437 --> 00:48:45,976
I want to thank you very much.
Better luck next time. You're a good sport.

506
00:48:46,076 --> 00:48:48,812
Hiding his past from his fellow employees...

507
00:48:48,912 --> 00:48:53,350
Virgil does well at his first decent job,
the mail room.

508
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,853
His past catches up with him, however...

509
00:48:55,953 --> 00:48:58,989
...as a fellow employee
learns of his criminal record.

510
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:01,058
What are you doing for dinner, Mr. Public?

511
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:04,161
Miss Blair. I'm having dinner
with my wife. Why?

512
00:49:04,261 --> 00:49:06,663
We're having dinner, Mr. Public.

513
00:49:06,763 --> 00:49:09,199
No, I said I was having dinner with my wife.

514
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:12,274
I found this picture in a magazine.

515
00:49:12,402 --> 00:49:16,567
One word from me,
and you're back in prison. Okay?

516
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:18,876
What do you feel like eating?

517
00:49:18,976 --> 00:49:22,346
Virgil Starkwell becomes the victim
of a blackmail plot.

518
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:25,082
Miss Blair, confident of her power
to expose him...

519
00:49:25,182 --> 00:49:27,951
...begins making small demands for money.

520
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:30,686
These increase as time goes on.

521
00:49:30,988 --> 00:49:33,824
Everything that he holds dear to him
is in jeopardy.

522
00:49:33,924 --> 00:49:37,527
His life and family hang on the whim
of an unstable woman.

523
00:49:37,627 --> 00:49:39,496
He is driven to desperation...

524
00:49:39,596 --> 00:49:43,100
...and with the responsibility
of a wife and child to protect...

525
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,397
Virgil Starkwell contemplates murder.

526
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,935
What would you like to drink?

527
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:51,339
What do you have?

528
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:56,210
How about some sherry?
I have some very fine sherry.

529
00:50:01,818 --> 00:50:03,818
What's the matter?

530
00:50:04,688 --> 00:50:06,688
Did you hurt your hand?

531
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:09,257
Clumsy.

532
00:50:09,793 --> 00:50:11,793
I'll be right in.

533
00:50:14,297 --> 00:50:17,334
Disguising two sticks of dynamite
as candles...

534
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:20,919
...he sends Miss Blair an anonymous gift.

535
00:50:24,174 --> 00:50:25,509
The plot fails, however...

536
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:30,113
...as he makes the dynamite too thick
to fit into the candlesticks.

537
00:50:30,213 --> 00:50:33,016
Determined to rid himself
of the blackmailer...

538
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:37,111
...he rents a car and
attempts to run her over.

539
00:51:01,111 --> 00:51:03,947
I think somebody's trying to kill me.

540
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:05,515
Don't be silly.

541
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:09,152
When I came home from work last night,
there was a car in my living room...

542
00:51:09,252 --> 00:51:10,721
...and it tried to run me over.

543
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:13,090
It must be your imagination.
- No.

544
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:16,727
Who'd try and kill you?
- I don't know. I have no enemies.

545
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:20,057
You didn't tell anybody, did you?
- No.

546
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,330
You can do the carving.

547
00:51:37,214 --> 00:51:40,851
Can't you wait?
I mean, you eat like an animal.

548
00:51:40,951 --> 00:51:42,285
It's delicious, really.

549
00:51:42,385 --> 00:51:45,455
I'll get the salad dressing,
we'll make a toast...

550
00:51:45,555 --> 00:51:49,040
...and then you start on that turkey leg.

551
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:15,152
What are you doing in there?

552
00:52:15,252 --> 00:52:18,121
I'm just creating
the proper atmosphere, dear.

553
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:19,623
I'm a sucker for atmosphere.

554
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:23,894
Why don't you carve the turkey?
- Yes, of course, my darling.

555
00:52:23,994 --> 00:52:26,763
Someone sent these as a gift,
but they were too big to use...

556
00:52:26,863 --> 00:52:29,413
...so I shaved off the bottom.

557
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:36,139
With law enforcement
agencies on his trail...

558
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:38,775
Virgil takes his family and heads south.

559
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:43,380
Here, they manage to secure
cheap lodging temporarily.

560
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:48,919
This was really a desperate time in my life.
We had no money.

561
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:53,924
I tried mugging old ladies,
but I got hit in the groin with a crutch.

562
00:52:54,024 --> 00:52:57,461
I didn't know what to do.
I tried counterfeiting for a while.

563
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:00,397
I just got the plates
all fouled up and everything...

564
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:03,467
...and Lincoln came out
smoking a cigarette.

565
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:06,670
I robbed a butcher shop.
That was the best I could do.

566
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,339
I got away with 116 veal cutlets.

567
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:14,539
Then I had to go out and rob
a tremendous amount of breading.

568
00:53:25,055 --> 00:53:27,958
Their money gone, and with food scarce...

569
00:53:28,058 --> 00:53:31,713
...the Starkwells live like hunted animals.

570
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,098
You weren't very happy then?

571
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:08,431
No, this was the low point of my existence.

572
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:11,001
I was thinking of
getting out of crime altogether...

573
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:13,436
...maybe becoming a singer or something.

574
00:54:13,536 --> 00:54:16,540
Must've been a very tough decision
for you to make.

575
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,020
Yeah, it was really tough...

576
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:23,713
...but my family was starving,
and I had already filed for bankruptcy.

577
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:25,813
I see.

578
00:54:25,982 --> 00:54:27,784
What prompted you to go on?

579
00:54:27,884 --> 00:54:32,489
I came up with an idea for a robbery
that was so fantastic and so brilliant...

580
00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:35,492
...that when it was over,
it was considered a real work of art...

581
00:54:35,592 --> 00:54:37,460
...by all the guys in my cell block.

582
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:43,340
They must've looked up to you.
- Well, you know, these guys are mugs.

583
00:54:44,968 --> 00:54:47,937
I'm gonna rob a bank.

584
00:54:48,505 --> 00:54:50,505
No, Virgil, not again.

585
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,309
Yes, I think so.

586
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:55,345
I think that our only way out of this mess
is for me to...

587
00:54:55,445 --> 00:54:58,048
There's a little dinky bank in Ross County...

588
00:54:58,148 --> 00:55:00,350
...and I think if I can get
two or three good men...

589
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,751
I can get in there and get it...

590
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:06,441
...and we could go down to Mexico
or up to Canada or...

591
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:11,094
But what if you got killed?
- No, don't worry. I know how to use a gub.

592
00:55:11,194 --> 00:55:12,395
No, it's 'gun,' Virgil.

593
00:55:12,495 --> 00:55:16,405
'Gun,' I'm sorry. Did I say 'gub' again?
- Yes.

594
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:29,110
Don't turn around.

595
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:34,211
I wanna speak to you
about a business proposition.

596
00:55:38,121 --> 00:55:40,121
It's a bank job.

597
00:55:41,224 --> 00:55:43,627
Couple of guys and myself
are gonna get together...

598
00:55:43,727 --> 00:55:47,097
...about four weeks from now.
Quarter of a million dollars.

599
00:55:47,197 --> 00:55:49,666
We walk in and take it like that.

600
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:53,251
It's an easy job. See, we just pull up...

601
00:55:53,703 --> 00:55:55,703
...take it.

602
00:56:01,511 --> 00:56:04,446
How long have you been...

603
00:56:04,514 --> 00:56:07,829
Because I said the part about the bank.

604
00:56:11,855 --> 00:56:14,745
You guys are dressing alike again.

605
00:56:18,428 --> 00:56:20,428
I broke it myself.

606
00:56:20,997 --> 00:56:24,034
All the boys in the neighborhood
went wrong. It wasn't his fault.

607
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:26,536
We didn't have time for him.
We were working.

608
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:28,471
Would you like to see my stamp collection?

609
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:31,975
What do you mean?
- I have a collection of stamps.

610
00:56:32,075 --> 00:56:35,220
First he selects an appropriate bank.

611
00:56:35,512 --> 00:56:38,381
Next, he cases the bank
by cleverly concealing a camera...

612
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:40,776
...in an unsuspected place.

613
00:56:49,092 --> 00:56:51,194
That night, a meeting takes place.

614
00:56:51,294 --> 00:56:55,699
Among the ones chosen are some of
the most sinister names in the underworld.

615
00:56:55,799 --> 00:56:59,402
William Ommers,
wanted by the police for bank robbery...

616
00:56:59,502 --> 00:57:06,472
...assault with a deadly weapon, murder,
and getting naked in front of his in-laws.

617
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:08,545
Frankie Wolf:

618
00:57:08,645 --> 00:57:13,405
Wanted by Federal authorities
for dancing with a mailman.

619
00:57:14,117 --> 00:57:15,719
Abie Armstrong:

620
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:18,855
Wanted all over the country
for arson, robbery...

621
00:57:18,955 --> 00:57:23,375
...assault with intent to kill,
and marrying a horse.

622
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:31,299
All right, boys.

623
00:57:31,468 --> 00:57:34,938
We're gonna talk about
the Union Fidelity Bank.

624
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:37,038
June 16...

625
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,508
...10 a.m.

626
00:57:38,608 --> 00:57:42,011
What you're about to see are films
of the Union Fidelity Bank.

627
00:57:42,111 --> 00:57:44,013
We're gonna see them just once.

628
00:57:44,113 --> 00:57:47,083
Then, to destroy the evidence,
we're gonna eat the film.

629
00:57:47,183 --> 00:57:50,620
It'll be buffet style and you can
help yourself. Take plates.

630
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,556
There's potato salad over there,
and my wife made coffee.

631
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:56,546
These films could save your lives.

632
00:58:07,604 --> 00:58:10,154
There's always a boring short.

633
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,008
He'd have the gang over for meetings.

634
00:58:15,512 --> 00:58:19,677
I'd put out little trays of pretzels and bullets.

635
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:22,951
I had to. He's my husband.

636
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:25,091
We got this film camera.

637
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,870
We got lights, we got a truck.

638
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:32,728
The idea is we pull up in front of the bank
and we look like we're making a movie.

639
00:58:32,828 --> 00:58:34,530
We play the actors.

640
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:38,285
All we need is somebody to be the director.

641
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:41,235
I got the perfect guy.

642
00:58:42,171 --> 00:58:47,074
An ex-con I did some time with
by the name of... Fritz.

643
00:58:47,976 --> 00:58:49,976
I'll be the director.

644
00:58:50,946 --> 00:58:53,015
I once was a film director.

645
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:55,684
Many years ago, before movies had sound.

646
00:58:55,784 --> 00:58:59,188
I worked with John Gilbert,
Rudolph Valentino, and Ruth and Gehrig.

647
00:58:59,288 --> 00:59:00,956
Ruth and Gehrig were baseball players.

648
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:04,992
I was also bat boy for the Yankees.

649
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:12,650
The fools in Hollywood,
they didn't recognize genius.

650
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:18,807
But now, I shall wear the uniform
of a director once again.

651
00:59:18,907 --> 00:59:21,899
And you will be my actor.

652
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:26,682
You will enter the bank and say,
'Up with your hands, this is a stickup.'

653
00:59:26,782 --> 00:59:31,446
Thereby announcing our theme:
Men's greed.

654
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,423
Now say it. Let me hear the line.

655
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:40,388
Up with your hands, this is a stickup.
- No. More feeling. Again, now.

656
00:59:40,762 --> 00:59:45,290
This is a bank robbery, not a movie.
- Yes, of course.

657
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:47,601
Forgive me.

658
00:59:47,636 --> 00:59:51,801
I will be fine when the time comes.
Thank you all.

659
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,140
Everybody, take five.

660
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:12,528
Don't tell me you're gonna use
the shower now.

661
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:15,831
Why do you do this to me every morning?
I just got in here.

662
01:00:15,931 --> 01:00:18,433
I'm gonna be late for the robbery.

663
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:21,370
So you'll be five minutes late.
They can start without you.

664
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,672
They can't start without me. I'm the leader.

665
01:00:23,772 --> 01:00:27,071
I made you some coffee.
- Jesus.

666
01:00:27,776 --> 01:00:33,556
Everyday I have trouble getting
in the bathroom. For crying out loud.

667
01:00:36,451 --> 01:00:39,788
Honey, what shirt do you want to wear?
- What'd you say?

668
01:00:39,888 --> 01:00:42,157
I said, what shirt do you want to wear?

669
01:00:42,257 --> 01:00:44,722
I'm gonna wear my light blue.

670
01:00:45,093 --> 01:00:48,597
No, you're not. It was dirty.
I washed it last night.

671
01:00:48,697 --> 01:00:50,766
Why did you wash it?
I was gonna wear it today.

672
01:00:50,866 --> 01:00:52,401
I washed it because it was dirty.

673
01:00:52,501 --> 01:00:54,169
So what? I'm just gonna rob a bank.

674
01:00:54,269 --> 01:00:56,471
I've ironed the beige one.
Do you wanna wear that?

675
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:58,807
Not to a bank robbery.
- Why not?

676
01:00:58,907 --> 01:01:01,043
Because it's light. I'll be an easy target.

677
01:01:01,143 --> 01:01:04,079
I think it's a perfectly good shirt to wear.
- No, it isn't.

678
01:01:04,179 --> 01:01:07,883
Who wears beige to a bank robbery?
- What are the other guys wearing?

679
01:01:07,983 --> 01:01:10,152
I don't know. For crying out loud.

680
01:01:10,252 --> 01:01:12,321
Why don't you call them up and ask them?

681
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:18,286
Nobody's gonna be wearing beige
to a bank robbery. It's in poor taste.

682
01:01:24,967 --> 01:01:28,937
June 16th, 9:00 a.m.
The days of planning are over.

683
01:01:29,037 --> 01:01:31,840
Virgil and his accomplices
depart from his hideout...

684
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:35,340
...and proceed toward their destination.

685
01:02:08,143 --> 01:02:12,053
Everybody get your hands up.
This is a stickup.

686
01:02:18,186 --> 01:02:20,088
What are you doing here?

687
01:02:20,188 --> 01:02:22,658
We're holding up the bank.
- We're holding up the bank.

688
01:02:22,758 --> 01:02:26,161
No, sorry, we're holding up the bank.
- We are holding up the bank.

689
01:02:26,261 --> 01:02:27,863
No, we were here first.

690
01:02:27,963 --> 01:02:30,499
Could you come back tomorrow?
We'll be finished by then.

691
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:32,546
We've been planning this for months.

692
01:02:32,646 --> 01:02:35,037
We're not gonna have it
ruined by a jackass.

693
01:02:35,137 --> 01:02:36,405
All right, we'll take a vote.

694
01:02:36,505 --> 01:02:41,520
How many people here
would like to be held up by this group?

695
01:02:43,345 --> 01:02:48,275
Now, how many people
would like to be held up by our group?

696
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:52,585
Now beat it.

697
01:02:54,623 --> 01:02:57,148
You call this a bank robbery?

698
01:02:57,492 --> 01:03:01,588
I yelled 'action' five minutes ago.

699
01:03:02,597 --> 01:03:05,402
Is this the way to pick up money?

700
01:03:08,336 --> 01:03:10,906
What's going on here?
There's a million cops outside.

701
01:03:11,006 --> 01:03:13,006
Let's get out of here.

702
01:03:30,258 --> 01:03:33,929
Each member of the gang
gets five years for his part in the crime.

703
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:36,029
Virgil gets ten.

704
01:03:36,098 --> 01:03:39,735
He is taken, not to prison this time,
but to a road gang...

705
01:03:39,835 --> 01:03:43,939
...where his criminal behavior
will cost him dearly.

706
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:48,119
You men come here
because you committed crimes...

707
01:03:48,143 --> 01:03:51,480
...rendering you unfit to
live in decent society.

708
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,181
That's too bad.

709
01:03:53,281 --> 01:03:58,186
I think you're gonna find
you made a mistake you're gonna regret.

710
01:03:58,286 --> 01:04:02,991
Our job, mine and the boys, is to see
that you get some civilization in you...

711
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:06,995
...so that when you leave here,
you're gonna think twice...

712
01:04:07,095 --> 01:04:10,223
...about performing antisocial acts.

713
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,500
My advice to you...

714
01:04:14,102 --> 01:04:16,271
...is to obey the rules and do your job.

715
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:17,839
You got any complaints, come to me.

716
01:04:17,939 --> 01:04:22,019
There ain't nobody on the outside
gonna help you.

717
01:04:22,244 --> 01:04:26,581
We don't like complainers
and we don't like troublemakers.

718
01:04:26,681 --> 01:04:30,931
If things get
a little too rough for you in here...

719
01:04:31,153 --> 01:04:34,893
...you're just free to take off for Florida.

720
01:04:35,824 --> 01:04:39,479
Show them which direction Florida is, boys.

721
01:04:46,001 --> 01:04:48,001
Any questions?

722
01:04:48,637 --> 01:04:51,239
Do you think a girl should pet
on the first date?

723
01:04:51,339 --> 01:04:52,841
What?

724
01:04:52,941 --> 01:04:57,616
I mean, if both parties involved
are mature and liberal.

725
01:06:27,802 --> 01:06:30,639
You think you got a good enough aim...

726
01:06:30,739 --> 01:06:33,141
...for that hammer
to knock these bracelets off me?

727
01:06:33,241 --> 01:06:35,477
Man, I don't want no trouble.

728
01:06:35,577 --> 01:06:38,480
Nothing's gonna happen.
You think you can do it?

729
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:42,320
I've never missed yet.
- All right, go ahead.

730
01:06:52,527 --> 01:06:54,527
Sorry, man. First time.

731
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:03,438
Food on a chain gang is scarce
and not very nourishing.

732
01:07:03,538 --> 01:07:07,533
The men get one hot meal a day:
A bowl of steam.

733
01:07:14,282 --> 01:07:18,787
All right, boys,
who didn't give me a good day's work?

734
01:07:26,528 --> 01:07:28,528
Come with us, Wilson.

735
01:07:43,611 --> 01:07:46,581
What's the matter, Starkwell?
Can't you take it?

736
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:52,546
I want you to see this so you'll know
what you got to look forward to.

737
01:08:06,101 --> 01:08:09,004
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

738
01:08:09,104 --> 01:08:10,538
What do you mean?

739
01:08:10,638 --> 01:08:14,548
Don't beat the shadow, you damn fool.
Beat him.

740
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:16,642
Him.

741
01:08:17,245 --> 01:08:22,260
The time drags by in an endless grind
of backbreaking labor.

742
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:26,354
Brutal discipline is common
under the hot sun.

743
01:08:26,454 --> 01:08:30,091
The men are not even permitted to faint
without written permission.

744
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:33,461
Virgil complains,
and he is severely tortured.

745
01:08:33,561 --> 01:08:37,232
For several days, he is locked
in a sweat box with an insurance salesman.

746
01:08:37,332 --> 01:08:41,703
Hello, I'm Joe Green, and I represent
the Ajax-Witches Insurance company.

747
01:08:41,803 --> 01:08:45,140
I'd like to talk to you about your insurance.
You're about 30, right?

748
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:49,344
You know, I think the best thing to do is
to get straight life, plus a little term.

749
01:08:49,444 --> 01:08:51,446
And how about dental and medical?

750
01:08:51,546 --> 01:08:55,456
We've got this major medical.
It's a good deal.

751
01:08:57,085 --> 01:09:00,588
At the end of each day, the men are
chained to each other by the ankle...

752
01:09:00,688 --> 01:09:04,292
...in groups of six,
making movement slow and painful...

753
01:09:04,392 --> 01:09:06,517
...and escape impossible.

754
01:09:14,636 --> 01:09:18,291
Then, one day, the impossible is attempted.

755
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:26,181
See that field?

756
01:09:26,281 --> 01:09:28,650
If we make it across that field,
we'd be out of here.

757
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:33,088
We can take them by surprise,
if we all suddenly made a break for it.

758
01:09:33,188 --> 01:09:35,423
You're crazy.
- That's right.

759
01:09:35,523 --> 01:09:39,688
I'm a paranoid schizophrenic,
but I say we try it.

760
01:09:39,761 --> 01:09:43,501
Ain't that right, boys?
- Yeah, you're right.

761
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:07,689
I'm not with them. I wanted to stay.

762
01:10:07,789 --> 01:10:10,509
All right, everybody spread out.

763
01:11:59,667 --> 01:12:01,703
My car broke down. Can I use your phone?

764
01:12:01,803 --> 01:12:03,803
Of course. Come in.

765
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,994
We're gonna get out of here.
I know a guy in town...

766
01:12:26,094 --> 01:12:30,769
...who's got enough tools
to get us out of these chains.

767
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:36,414
All right. You act natural
and answer it or you're finished.

768
01:12:36,604 --> 01:12:38,006
Who is it?

769
01:12:38,106 --> 01:12:40,741
Patrolman Lynch. Can I come in?

770
01:12:40,842 --> 01:12:42,343
Well, not now.

771
01:12:42,443 --> 01:12:45,013
It's an emergency. I'm afraid I'll have to.

772
01:12:45,113 --> 01:12:46,447
You better untie her.

773
01:12:46,547 --> 01:12:51,052
Tell him we're your cousins
visiting from out of town.

774
01:12:56,491 --> 01:12:59,466
One false move and you're finished.

775
01:13:02,997 --> 01:13:03,998
What is it?

776
01:13:04,098 --> 01:13:06,467
I hear there's been some trouble
up at the prison.

777
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:09,270
I'm checking the area
for anything suspicious.

778
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:13,675
These are my cousins.
They're visiting me for the holiday.

779
01:13:13,775 --> 01:13:15,775
What holiday?

780
01:13:16,411 --> 01:13:20,014
Did you ever hear of St. Abernathy's Day?
- No.

781
01:13:20,114 --> 01:13:22,409
That's what we're here for.

782
01:13:22,884 --> 01:13:25,546
Come here, you. Come here.

783
01:13:32,493 --> 01:13:35,463
You think your cousin is safe
living here all alone?

784
01:13:35,563 --> 01:13:37,732
Look how close we are to the prison.

785
01:13:37,832 --> 01:13:42,082
Look out here.
It's just a few miles down the road.

786
01:13:42,103 --> 01:13:44,103
Come here.

787
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:49,041
I don't know.

788
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:52,947
You sure can't be sure
when you live so close to a prison.

789
01:13:53,047 --> 01:13:55,047
Wait a minute.

790
01:13:55,049 --> 01:13:57,752
Did I see something move out there?
- You couldn't have.

791
01:13:57,852 --> 01:14:02,724
I'm sure I saw something move. Quick.
Everybody take one window and check it.

792
01:14:02,824 --> 01:14:08,009
If there's somebody out there,
we'll have a chance to see him.

793
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,515
Guess it must have been my imagination.

794
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:19,572
Now?

795
01:14:20,408 --> 01:14:22,408
Excuse us.

796
01:14:36,758 --> 01:14:38,426
They're escaped convicts.

797
01:14:38,526 --> 01:14:40,461
Really?
- They've broken in.

798
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:44,065
Didn't you notice how they all
moved together closely?

799
01:14:44,165 --> 01:14:49,704
They're chained together at the ankles.
- I thought they were just a close family.

800
01:14:49,804 --> 01:14:52,272
Okay, boys, the game's up.

801
01:14:55,543 --> 01:14:57,745
The old lady must have told.

802
01:14:57,845 --> 01:15:03,795
You're going back to that prison
and this time you're gonna stay there.

803
01:15:06,454 --> 01:15:07,889
Where we gonna go? We need tools.

804
01:15:07,989 --> 01:15:11,899
Let's get my wife. She'll help us out of this.

805
01:15:18,566 --> 01:15:22,637
Virgil, if you'd only listened to me
and gone straight.

806
01:15:22,737 --> 01:15:26,140
Honey, we needed the money
and I robbed a bank.

807
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,309
When are you going to stop doing that?

808
01:15:28,409 --> 01:15:32,380
Don't you realize you're a father
and you have responsibilities.

809
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,415
If she was my wife, I'd belt her one.

810
01:15:34,515 --> 01:15:36,284
Do you mind keeping out of this, please?

811
01:15:36,384 --> 01:15:39,020
I don't wanna discuss
it, unless we're alone.

812
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,354
I wanna discuss it now.

813
01:15:40,454 --> 01:15:42,990
All right you don't wanna
discuss it alone. Okay.

814
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:44,058
Where are you going?

815
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:46,527
I'm going to the next room,
to talk about it right now.

816
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:49,063
I can't come in alone. I'm chained to the...

817
01:15:49,163 --> 01:15:53,000
We can't be alone unless we go someplace
where they got some tools or something.

818
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,136
These guys are with me for good now.

819
01:15:55,236 --> 01:15:56,504
How do you think I feel?

820
01:15:56,604 --> 01:16:00,854
I'm a young woman,
sleeping alone here every night.

821
01:16:01,309 --> 01:16:02,310
Darling, look...

822
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:05,113
Don't you think
that means something to me?

823
01:16:05,213 --> 01:16:07,949
I think back to the days
when you were in the Philharmonic.

824
01:16:08,049 --> 01:16:10,084
I was never in the Philharmonic.

825
01:16:10,184 --> 01:16:12,954
We used to lie in bed
and you used to make love to me.

826
01:16:13,054 --> 01:16:15,857
And you used to recite poetry...
- Poetry?

827
01:16:15,957 --> 01:16:20,462
And play with that doll you got me.
- Hey, Longfellow.

828
01:16:20,895 --> 01:16:22,630
Darling, look.

829
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:24,532
You guys look away for a minute.

830
01:16:24,632 --> 01:16:26,868
Sweetheart, don't you know
that whatever happens...

831
01:16:26,968 --> 01:16:29,937
...you're always gonna
mean the same to me.

832
01:16:30,037 --> 01:16:32,037
Will you stop giggling?

833
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:36,577
You'll always mean the sun,
and earth and the moon to me.

834
01:16:36,677 --> 01:16:38,677
Oh, Christ.

835
01:16:41,315 --> 01:16:44,852
With Louise's help,
the chains are removed from Virgil's ankles.

836
01:16:44,952 --> 01:16:47,188
Once more the family takes flight...

837
01:16:47,288 --> 01:16:53,408
...feeling guilty about their son's education.
Louise tries tutoring him.

838
01:16:57,064 --> 01:16:59,189
He's been very depressed.

839
01:17:02,336 --> 01:17:05,339
I think if he had been
a successful criminal...

840
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:07,734
...he would've felt better.

841
01:17:08,109 --> 01:17:12,213
You know, he never made
the 'Ten Most Wanted' list.

842
01:17:12,313 --> 01:17:15,483
It's very unfair voting. It's who you know.

843
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:18,219
Virgil Starkwell embarks on
a series of crimes...

844
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:21,379
...that make him a wanted desperado.

845
01:17:33,401 --> 01:17:35,536
Here, he attempts to rob
the vault of a bank...

846
01:17:35,636 --> 01:17:39,801
...but finds a family of Gypsies
are living there.

847
01:17:41,509 --> 01:17:46,447
By the end of six months,
the FBI regards Virgil as a menace.

848
01:17:46,547 --> 01:17:49,016
Although he does not make
the 'Ten Most Wanted' list...

849
01:17:49,116 --> 01:17:51,519
...he does win 'Gangster
of the Year' award...

850
01:17:51,619 --> 01:17:55,857
...and is asked to speak
at many luncheons and universities.

851
01:17:55,957 --> 01:17:58,726
For the end of this story,
we spoke to Mr. Daniel Miller...

852
01:17:58,826 --> 01:18:02,530
...an FBI agent and author of the book,
Mother Was A Red.

853
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:05,967
The FBI actually wanted Virgil very badly.

854
01:18:06,067 --> 01:18:10,371
Mr. Hoover was quite upset
by Mr. Starkwell and his activities.

855
01:18:10,471 --> 01:18:14,275
In fact, he confided to me
on several occasions.

856
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:19,046
I can remember one very well,
after a bowling match on Thursday night...

857
01:18:19,146 --> 01:18:21,518
...on which he said he
couldn't sleep nights,

858
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:23,451
he was smoking a little too much...

859
01:18:23,551 --> 01:18:27,954
...and he thought that this criminal...

860
01:18:28,189 --> 01:18:33,374
...as he put it, might very well be
part of a subversive plot.

861
01:18:34,795 --> 01:18:39,562
Obviously an atheist and a pinko...

862
01:18:40,201 --> 01:18:44,281
...and trying in general
to disturb our society.

863
01:18:45,139 --> 01:18:47,842
We finally traced him
to a cheap neighborhood...

864
01:18:47,942 --> 01:18:50,478
...down on the Lower
East Side of New York...

865
01:18:50,578 --> 01:18:55,016
...where he was living, at the time,
in a very sleazy, rundown tenement house.

866
01:18:55,116 --> 01:18:58,753
Virge? I remember him.
I used to live with him as a matter of fact.

867
01:18:58,853 --> 01:19:01,422
In the same rooming house, that is.

868
01:19:01,522 --> 01:19:04,225
One day, he told me he was a gynecologist.

869
01:19:04,325 --> 01:19:09,255
He couldn't speak no foreign languages.
Who was he kidding?

870
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:13,401
I thought I saw his picture on a post office...

871
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:17,772
I didn't remember whether it was
on the wall or on a stamp.

872
01:19:17,872 --> 01:19:20,422
Do you remember Virgil?
- Yeah.

873
01:19:20,441 --> 01:19:23,945
What was he like?
- I don't know. Now, I think he was brilliant.

874
01:19:24,045 --> 01:19:25,379
Just absolutely brilliant.

875
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:29,216
When I found out that he was a criminal,
I just couldn't believe lt.

876
01:19:29,316 --> 01:19:32,911
I just thought I was gonna die...

877
01:19:32,987 --> 01:19:36,157
'cause he just was the best cover-up job
I've ever seen in my life.

878
01:19:36,257 --> 01:19:37,959
I mean, unbelievable acting job.

879
01:19:38,059 --> 01:19:41,896
I actually believed that he was an idiot.
I really believed it.

880
01:19:41,996 --> 01:19:44,732
And I wasn't the only one.
Everybody thought so.

881
01:19:44,832 --> 01:19:48,035
Everyone thought he was a schlemiel,
and turns out he's a criminal.

882
01:19:48,135 --> 01:19:51,639
Just to think that that idiot was a criminal.
I just can't believe it.

883
01:19:51,739 --> 01:19:54,342
I mean, you never met anybody like this
in your life.

884
01:19:54,442 --> 01:19:56,243
You've never met such a nothing.

885
01:19:56,343 --> 01:19:59,213
I can't believe it.
That there was a mind working in there...

886
01:19:59,313 --> 01:20:02,416
...that could rob banks. It's phenomenal.

887
01:20:02,516 --> 01:20:06,020
Do you know that once I said to him,
'What do you do?'

888
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,452
He said, 'I rob banks.'

889
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:10,522
Go know?

890
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:12,893
But we finally caught up to him.

891
01:20:12,993 --> 01:20:16,731
I think it was April 11th.
We finally captured Virgil...

892
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:20,231
...under sort of very odd circumstances.

893
01:20:20,634 --> 01:20:23,904
An amateur photographer
happened to be there at the time...

894
01:20:24,004 --> 01:20:27,999
...and took the only known films
of his capture.

895
01:20:28,576 --> 01:20:31,779
I was coming down here.
This is the spot where it actually happened.

896
01:20:31,879 --> 01:20:32,913
You see.

897
01:20:33,013 --> 01:20:36,317
As a matter of fact, I had just
brought my pants in to the cleaners...

898
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:38,152
...and I was sort of angry with them...

899
01:20:38,252 --> 01:20:41,889
...because last time I asked them
to sew a button on and they hadn't.

900
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:44,199
Will you get to the point?

901
01:20:44,225 --> 01:20:46,225
Oh, yes. Well...

902
01:20:47,695 --> 01:20:51,599
I'll tell you exactly what happened
this morning with me.

903
01:20:51,699 --> 01:20:56,537
And about the camera. Well, back to
this thing in which I became known...

904
01:20:56,637 --> 01:20:59,106
...merely because of what happened
and I had the camera.

905
01:20:59,206 --> 01:21:01,342
I was having breakfast in the morning.

906
01:21:01,442 --> 01:21:04,757
I think it was two fried eggs, toast...

907
01:21:05,646 --> 01:21:10,451
...and juice, I don't know whether it was
orange or grapefruit.

908
01:21:10,551 --> 01:21:13,454
But at that time...
It was orange juice, that's right.

909
01:21:13,554 --> 01:21:14,955
Will you get to the point?

910
01:21:15,055 --> 01:21:17,792
I've got them right here.
I'd like to show them to you.

911
01:21:17,892 --> 01:21:19,393
The very last films...

912
01:21:19,493 --> 01:21:23,573
...of Virgil Starkwell
being captured by the FBI.

913
01:21:24,064 --> 01:21:26,667
All right, get your hands up.
This is a stickup.

914
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:30,422
I know you. Virgil Starkwell, that's right.

915
01:21:32,706 --> 01:21:35,681
Eddie? What? Haynes?
- That's right.

916
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:38,612
We were in the marching band together,
and you played a cello.

917
01:21:38,712 --> 01:21:40,848
I was trombone. First trombone.

918
01:21:40,948 --> 01:21:43,382
Isn't that funny? My God.

919
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:46,353
What are you doing?
- I'm with the Philharmonic.

920
01:21:46,453 --> 01:21:49,123
No kidding. That's great.
I was just talking to someone...

921
01:21:49,223 --> 01:21:52,526
Oscar Sunkin. About the great times
we used to have together, remember?

922
01:21:52,626 --> 01:21:54,028
They were hilarious.

923
01:21:54,128 --> 01:21:56,363
Do you do you remember
when we got caught...

924
01:21:56,463 --> 01:21:58,299
...taking a shower in the girls' locker room?

925
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:01,001
I do. You know,
I never saw anybody so embarrassed.

926
01:22:01,101 --> 01:22:02,236
I'll never forget your face.

927
01:22:02,336 --> 01:22:04,071
My face. You dropped the towel.

928
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:07,072
You dropped the towel, too.

929
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:08,976
Let me have your watch, will you?

930
01:22:09,076 --> 01:22:11,076
Yes, sure.

931
01:22:11,612 --> 01:22:15,548
Remember that... We
painted the car yellow.

932
01:22:15,616 --> 01:22:18,052
Right, on Halloween.
- That's right. It was Halloween.

933
01:22:18,152 --> 01:22:20,554
It was really funny.
- It was yellow stripes.

934
01:22:20,654 --> 01:22:22,723
That's right, like a barber pole.

935
01:22:22,823 --> 01:22:24,859
Keep your hands up
or I'll have to shoot you.

936
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:26,193
Yeah, sure.

937
01:22:26,293 --> 01:22:29,196
Jesus, remember the football game?
- You fumbled the last play.

938
01:22:29,296 --> 01:22:31,332
And you picked up the ball and ran with it.

939
01:22:31,432 --> 01:22:34,368
And then I ran the wrong way.
Everybody was yelling, 'Go back.'

940
01:22:34,468 --> 01:22:36,003
And I thought they were cheering.

941
01:22:36,103 --> 01:22:37,872
You can't beat the good old days.

942
01:22:37,972 --> 01:22:41,876
No, or the good old nights.
Shirley Sistrin. Remember?

943
01:22:41,976 --> 01:22:43,277
The wallet.

944
01:22:43,377 --> 01:22:45,607
I didn't hear you.

945
01:22:46,046 --> 01:22:48,682
It's been great speaking to you, really.

946
01:22:48,782 --> 01:22:51,585
It's so nice to see you.
- Yeah, you, too. Take it easy.

947
01:22:51,685 --> 01:22:54,989
Maybe I'll see you again.
- Best of luck to you.

948
01:22:55,089 --> 01:22:57,724
I just realized that I'm a cop.

949
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:00,494
No kidding. How's it going?
- It's a great job.

950
01:23:00,594 --> 01:23:04,928
I get a pension.
- Do you remember when we...

951
01:23:05,532 --> 01:23:08,936
Virgil Starkwell is tried on
52 counts of robbery...

952
01:23:09,036 --> 01:23:12,673
...and is sentenced to
800 years in federal prison.

953
01:23:12,773 --> 01:23:15,476
At the trial, he tells his lawyer confidently...

954
01:23:15,576 --> 01:23:18,879
...that with good behavior,
he can cut the sentence in half.

955
01:23:18,979 --> 01:23:22,850
Now that you're caught and you're facing
a very long prison sentence...

956
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:25,920
...do you have any regrets
about choosing a life of crime?

957
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,289
I think that crime definitely pays...

958
01:23:28,389 --> 01:23:31,559
...and that, you know, it's a great job.

959
01:23:31,659 --> 01:23:34,428
The hours are good,
and you're your own boss...

960
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:38,666
...and you travel a lot
and you get to meet interesting people.

961
01:23:38,766 --> 01:23:41,168
I just think it's a good job in general.

962
01:23:41,268 --> 01:23:44,772
What about your cohorts?
What ever happened to them?

963
01:23:44,872 --> 01:23:47,841
All the guys you've been associated with
in various gangs?

964
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:52,674
A great many of them
have become homosexuals...

965
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:56,550
...and some of them
have entered into politics and sports.

966
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:59,019
How do you manage to
spend your time in prison?

967
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:01,255
Do you have any hobbies or anything?

968
01:24:01,355 --> 01:24:03,355
I've been working on...

969
01:24:03,524 --> 01:24:07,061
I've been doing a lot of stuff
in shop, actually...

970
01:24:07,161 --> 01:24:09,496
...and I'm very skilled with my hands.

971
01:24:09,596 --> 01:24:12,316
Do you know if it's raining out?
