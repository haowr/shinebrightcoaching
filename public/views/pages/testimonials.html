I am a better version of myself because of her and for that I am forever grateful. Do yourself a favor and contact Leah, invest in yourself and experience your best version. </p>

This was all before her professional training and now with the skills she has learned, she’s been able to suggest an even more customized and well-rounded plan to help me get to my optimal health. For those suffering from auto-immune disorders or have food sensitivities for example that require one to eliminate or supplement certain foods, she has excellent knowledge in assisting one in what helps or hinders your plan. On top of these skills she also offers kind, gentle and encouraging words to keep you on track and focused on the goal.

Long story short, the weeks flew by and I learned how easy it was to open up and talk to her. With all the life experiences, she has faced and is continuing to face, I feel Leah is more than qualified to help you on your new journey. She is a very caring and compassionate person. She has a drive and passion to help people. Leah is a fantastic Wellness and Life Coach capable of creating real change in your life.

              <p class = "flow-text montserrat animated fadeIn" style="font-size:17px;">When I first started on this journey with Leah Kelly my life was in complete shambles. I was in desperate need of an overhaul in all areas of my life. I was experiencing debilitating anxiety attacks every day, chronic pain from an auto-immune disease, depression, no schedule and addiction problems which made keeping up with regular life almost impossible.

Leah provided a safe, non-judgmental space for me to work on realistic short and long-term goals to improve my quality of life. Knowing that she has gone through many challenges in her own life and overcame them gave me the inspiration to try. 

Since I started, I have now implemented a bedtime and morning routine which has really helped me to attend all of my doctor's appointments and work. Also, I have incorporated exercise, healthy eating, meal planning and spending time in quiet devotion. I have begun to love myself for the first time in my whole life!

Leah is such a good Wellness Coach. I cannot express how much working with her has changed my life. She is empathetic, approachable, enthusiastic, very knowledgeable about health and nutrition, and will go above and beyond for her clients.  </p>
